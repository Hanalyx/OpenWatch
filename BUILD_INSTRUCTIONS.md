# OpenWatch RPM Build Instructions for Version 1.2.1-7

## Summary
The owladm source code fixes have been implemented and are ready for RPM packaging. The build process has been updated to ensure all current source code changes are included.

## Changes Made

### 1. owladm Source Code Fixes (Already Implemented)
- `internal/owladm/utils/prerequisites.go`: Fixed directory permission handling with graceful fallback
- `internal/owladm/cmd/start.go`: Enhanced environment detection for production vs development

### 2. RPM Specification Updated
- Version bumped from 1.2.1-6 to 1.2.1-7
- Added changelog entry documenting the fixes
- File: `packaging/rpm/openwatch.spec`

### 3. Build Script Enhanced
- Modified `packaging/rpm/build-rpm.sh` to use `tar` instead of `git archive`
- This ensures all current source files (including fixes) are included in the RPM
- No longer dependent on git repository state

## Build Process

To build the new RPM with the owladm fixes:

```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch/packaging/rpm
chmod +x build-rpm.sh
./build-rpm.sh
```

Or use the minimal build script:

```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch
chmod +x build-minimal.sh
./build-minimal.sh
```

## Expected Results

After building, you should have:
- `openwatch-1.2.1-7.x86_64.rpm` - Binary RPM with fixed owladm
- `openwatch-1.2.1-7.src.rpm` - Source RPM

These will be placed in `packaging/rpm/dist/`

## Verification

The new RPM will contain the owladm binary compiled from the fixed source code that:
1. Handles permission errors gracefully in production installations
2. Properly detects production vs development environments
3. Resolves the "operation not permitted" errors on security/keys directory
4. Fixes the "missing backend/app/main.py" environment detection issues

## Root Cause Resolution

The original issue was that source code fixes existed but weren't being included in the RPM because:
1. The build process used `git archive HEAD` which required committed changes
2. The repository wasn't properly initialized for git operations
3. The build script now uses `tar` to package current source files directly

This ensures that the RPM build process includes all current source code changes, providing the fixed owladm functionality to resolve the user's installation issues.
