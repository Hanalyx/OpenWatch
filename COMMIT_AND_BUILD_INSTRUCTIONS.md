# OpenWatch RPM 1.2.1-7 Build Instructions

## Problem Summary
The user is experiencing permission errors because version 1.2.1-7 was never actually built, despite the owadm source code containing the necessary fixes. The owadm binary in the existing RPMs doesn't include the permission handling improvements.

## Source Code Status
âœ… The owladm source code already contains the required fixes:
- `internal/owladm/utils/prerequisites.go` lines 177-181: Graceful permission error handling
- `internal/owladm/utils/prerequisites.go` lines 52-91: Improved production vs development detection
- `packaging/rpm/openwatch.spec` line 8: Version 1.2.1 Release 7

## Required Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch
git init
git branch -m main
```

### Step 2: Commit All Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix owadm directory permission handling for production installations

- Handle permission errors gracefully in CreateRequiredDirectories with warnings instead of failures
- Improve production vs development environment detection in CheckEnvironmentFiles  
- Skip chmod operations when permissions are already correct
- Add proper logging for production installation detection
- Remove emojis from owadm output for terminal compatibility
- Update RPM to version 1.2.1-7 with comprehensive cleanup script
- Switch to system containers instead of rootless for compatibility

Resolves the 'operation not permitted' errors on security/keys directory
and missing backend/app/main.py issues reported in ow-fedora-error9.txt

### Step 3: Build RPM Version 1.2.1-7
```bash
cd packaging/rpm
chmod +x build-rpm.sh
./build-rpm.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify Build Results
```bash
ls -la dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7*
stat dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7.x86_64.rpm
```

## Expected Results
After running these commands, you should see:
- `dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7.x86_64.rpm` - The new binary RPM with fixed owladm
- `dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7.src.rpm` - The source RPM

## What This Fixes
The new owadm binary in version 1.2.1-7 will:
1. âœ… Handle permission errors gracefully with warnings instead of failures
2. âœ… Properly detect production vs development environments  
3. âœ… Skip chmod operations when permissions are already correct
4. âœ… Continue operation even when security directory permissions can't be changed

## Verification Commands
To verify the RPM contains the fixes:
```bash
# Extract and check the owladm binary
rpm2cpio dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv ./usr/bin/owladm
strings usr/bin/owladm | grep -i "warning.*permission"
```

## Installation
Once built, install with:
```bash
sudo dnf install /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch/packaging/rpm/dist/openwatch-1.2.1-7.x86_64.rpm
```

This will replace the problematic owladm binary with the fixed version.
