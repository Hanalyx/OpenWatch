# Data Loss Fix Summary

## Problem

User reported all configuration data disappeared after running:
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh
./start-openwatch.sh --force-build --runtime docker
```

All hosts, system credentials, and compliance rules were lost, despite Docker volumes being properly configured.

## Root Cause

The `stop-openwatch.sh` script defaulted to **CLEAN_MODE=true**, which executed:
```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

This deleted all Docker volumes, including:
- `openwatch_postgres_data` - User accounts, hosts, scan history
- `openwatch_mongodb_data` - Compliance rules (1,387 SCAP rules)
- `openwatch_app_data` - Uploaded SCAP content and scan results

**Critical code (line 21 of stop-openwatch.sh):**
```bash
CLEAN_MODE=${OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP:-true}  # Default to clean stop for development
```

The script was designed for rapid development iteration, but users expected "stop" to preserve data.

## Solution

Changed default behavior from **destructive** to **safe**:

### Changes to stop-openwatch.sh

1. **Changed default to safe mode** (line 21):
```bash
# Before:
CLEAN_MODE=${OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP:-true}  # Default to clean stop for development

# After:
CLEAN_MODE=${OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP:-false}  # Default to SAFE stop - preserves data
```

2. **Added prominent warnings** when clean mode is active:
```bash
log_warning "‚ö†Ô∏è  CLEAN MODE: Will DELETE ALL DATA (volumes will be removed)"
log_warning "‚ö†Ô∏è  This includes hosts, credentials, scan results, and SCAP content"
```

3. **Updated help documentation** to clarify safe vs clean behavior

4. **Updated default messaging**:
```bash
log_info "Safe mode: Stopping containers but preserving data volumes"
log_info "Use OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true for clean development environment"
```

### New Behavior

**Safe stop (default):**
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh
# Containers stopped, data preserved
```

**Clean stop (explicit):**
```bash
OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true ./stop-openwatch.sh
# Containers stopped, ALL DATA DELETED
```

**Nuclear option (unchanged):**
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh --deep-clean
# Removes containers, volumes, networks, orphans
```

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

1. **docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md** - Complete guide covering:
   - Volume mappings and data storage
   - Safe vs clean mode comparison
   - Common scenarios with examples
   - Troubleshooting data issues
   - Backup procedures
   - Best practices

2. **README.md updates**:
   - Added warning about data preservation
   - Updated container runtime examples
   - Added "Data disappeared after restart" troubleshooting section

## Testing

Verified changes:
```bash
# Test help message
./stop-openwatch.sh --help
# ‚úÖ Shows safe mode as default
# ‚úÖ Shows warnings about data deletion
# ‚úÖ Shows correct usage examples

# Test safe mode
./stop-openwatch.sh
# ‚úÖ Shows "Safe mode: Preserving data volumes"
# ‚úÖ Does NOT pass --volumes to docker-compose

# Test clean mode
OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true ./stop-openwatch.sh
# ‚úÖ Shows "CLEAN MODE: Will DELETE ALL DATA"
# ‚úÖ Shows warning about data types
```

## Impact

**Positive:**
- Users' data will be preserved across restarts
- Principle of least surprise - "stop" no longer deletes data
- Explicit opt-in required for destructive operations
- Clear warnings when data will be deleted

**Neutral:**
- Developers need to use `OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true` for clean environments
- Adds one extra step for development workflow
- Disk space usage may increase (volumes not automatically cleaned)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing flags still work (`--simple`, `--deep-clean`)
- Environment variable still works (just inverted default)
- Docker volume behavior unchanged
- Container runtime detection unchanged

## User Impact

**For the reporting user:**
- Data already lost (must re-enter hosts, credentials, SCAP content)
- Future restarts will preserve data
- Update to latest `stop-openwatch.sh` via `git pull`

**For all users:**
- Safer default behavior prevents accidental data loss
- Must explicitly request data deletion
- Better matches user expectations

## Migration Notes

**Scripts that relied on automatic cleanup:**

Before:
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh  # Deleted all data
```

After (equivalent behavior):
```bash
OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true ./stop-openwatch.sh  # Deletes all data
```

**Scripts that preserved data:**

Before:
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh --simple  # Preserved data
```

After (unchanged):
```bash
./stop-openwatch.sh           # Preserves data (now default)
./stop-openwatch.sh --simple  # Also preserves data (unchanged)
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Default mode changed from clean to safe
- [x] Warnings added for destructive operations
- [x] Help text updated with correct examples
- [x] Documentation created (DATA_PERSISTENCE.md)
- [x] README updated with troubleshooting
- [x] Tested help message output
- [x] Verified volume preservation behavior
- [x] No breaking changes to existing flags
- [x] Environment variable behavior inverted but working

## Files Changed

1. `stop-openwatch.sh` - 5 edits to default behavior and messaging
2. `docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md` - New comprehensive guide (350+ lines)
3. `README.md` - Updated container runtime section and troubleshooting
4. `DATA_LOSS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Commit Message

```
Fix data loss: Change stop-openwatch.sh default to safe mode

BREAKING CHANGE for development workflows:
- Default behavior now PRESERVES data volumes (was: delete)
- Must use OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true for clean development environment

Problem:
Users reported all data (hosts, credentials, SCAP content) disappeared
after running ./stop-openwatch.sh. Root cause: script defaulted to
CLEAN_MODE=true which runs "docker-compose down --volumes".

Solution:
- Changed CLEAN_MODE default from true to false
- Added prominent warnings when clean mode is active
- Updated help text to clarify safe vs destructive behavior
- Created comprehensive DATA_PERSISTENCE.md documentation

Impact:
- Safe by default: "stop" no longer deletes data
- Explicit opt-in required for destructive operations
- Principle of least surprise: matches user expectations

Migration:
Old: ./stop-openwatch.sh                    # Deleted data
New: OPENWATCH_CLEAN_STOP=true ./stop-openwatch.sh  # Equivalent

Files changed:
- stop-openwatch.sh: Default to safe mode with warnings
- docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md: Complete data persistence guide
- README.md: Updated usage examples and troubleshooting
- DATA_LOSS_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Technical documentation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Default to safe** - Destructive operations should require explicit opt-in
2. **Warn prominently** - Critical operations need visual warnings
3. **Document behavior** - Users need clear documentation of data handling
4. **Test user assumptions** - "Stop" should not delete data
5. **Fail safe** - Better to waste disk space than lose user data
