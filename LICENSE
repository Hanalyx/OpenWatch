# OpenWatch Community License (AGPLv3 + Managed Service Exception)

**Version 1.0 – 2025 Hanalyx LLC**

## 1. Base License

OpenWatch Core (the "Software") is licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 ("AGPLv3") as published by the Free Software Foundation.

The full text of the AGPLv3 is available at:
[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)

This License Addendum ("Managed Service Exception" or "MSE") modifies certain terms of the AGPLv3 as applied to the Software.

## 2. Managed Service Restriction

You may not provide the Software, or any modified version of it, as part of a managed service, hosted service, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering to third parties without prior written permission or a commercial license from Hanalyx LLC.

For the purpose of this restriction:

* "Offering as a managed service" means making the Software's functionality available to third parties over a network, where those third parties can access or use the Software without running their own instance.
* Running the Software for your own internal business purposes—whether on-premises or in your own cloud account—is permitted.

## 3. Rights Retained Under AGPLv3

Except for the restriction in Section 2, you retain all rights granted under the AGPLv3, including the rights to:

* Use, study, and modify the Software for any purpose.
* Distribute original or modified versions of the Software.
* Provide source code to users who interact with the Software over a network, as required by AGPLv3 Section 13.

All AGPLv3 obligations and copyleft conditions remain in full effect.

## 4. Commercial Licensing

A commercial license is available from Hanalyx LLC for organizations that wish to:

* Offer OpenWatch Core as a managed or hosted service to third parties, or
* Integrate it into proprietary commercial products under different terms.

## 5. Precedence

If any term of this Addendum conflicts with the AGPLv3, the Managed Service Exception shall take precedence solely with respect to the Managed Service Restriction described in Section 2.

## 6. Disclaimer

This License is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. See the AGPLv3 for full terms and conditions.
