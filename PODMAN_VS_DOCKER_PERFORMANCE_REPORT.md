## Key Performance Insights

### ðŸš€ **Performance Winners**
- **CPU Efficiency:** Docker uses 5.6% less CPU on average
- **Memory Efficiency:** Docker uses 0.3% less memory


### ðŸ”’ **Security Advantages**

- **Podman:** Rootless containers by default - enhanced security posture
- **Docker:** Traditional root-based containers - requires additional hardening
- **FIPS Compliance:** Podman supports FIPS mode out of the box

### âš¡ **Operational Characteristics**

- **Startup Time:** Both runtimes show similar container startup performance
- **Resource Stability:** Both show consistent resource usage patterns
- **Scalability:** Both handle basic workloads effectively

## Production Deployment Recommendations

### Choose Podman When:
- **Security is paramount** (rootless containers)
- **FIPS compliance** is required
- **Enterprise environments** with strict security policies
- **Government/defense** deployments

### Choose Docker When:
- **Maximum compatibility** with existing tooling is needed
- **Team familiarity** with Docker is high
- **Legacy deployment** pipelines are in use

### Universal Recommendations:
- **Resource Planning:** Allocate 4GB+ RAM and 2+ CPU cores minimum
- **Monitoring:** Implement continuous resource monitoring in production
- **Testing:** Use owadm CLI for unified management across both runtimes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### OpenWatch Compatibility
- âœ… **Dual Runtime Support:** owadm CLI works with both Docker and Podman
- âœ… **Auto-Detection:** Automatic runtime selection (prefers Podman)
- âœ… **Environment Modes:** Separate dev/prod configurations
- âœ… **Security Integration:** Built-in key management and encryption

### Performance Optimization Tips
1. **Container Limits:** Set appropriate CPU/memory limits
2. **Storage Driver:** Use overlay for best performance
3. **Network Mode:** Consider host networking for high-throughput scenarios
4. **Volume Optimization:** Use tmpfs for temporary data

## Test Data Summary

- **Podman Test Samples:** 23
- **Docker Test Samples:** 12
- **Container Types Tested:** nginx (web server), redis (database)
- **Test Duration:** ~2-3 minutes per runtime

## Conclusion

Both Podman and Docker provide excellent performance for OpenWatch deployment. **Podman is recommended for production environments** due to its superior security model with rootless containers, while Docker remains a solid choice for development and environments with existing Docker infrastructure.

The performance differences are minimal in most scenarios, making security and operational requirements the primary decision factors.
