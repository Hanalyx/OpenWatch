# Security Assessment & Credentials Work Integration Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Purpose:** Analyze how recent unified_credentials work relates to Security Assessment findings

---

## Executive Summary

Our recent Phases 1-5 authentication work **directly addresses** several critical security findings from the October 15, 2025 comprehensive security assessment. This document maps our completed work to the security assessment and identifies remaining security tasks.

---

## Work Completed: Phases 1-5 Authentication System

### What We Built
1. ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Host-specific credential resolution with fallback logic
2. ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Host monitoring respects auth_method configuration
3. ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: "Both" authentication method (SSH key + password fallback)
4. ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: Password credential system assessment (API exists)
5. ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: Host-specific credential UI integrated with unified_credentials

### Key Achievements
- Migrated from legacy `encrypted_credentials` to `unified_credentials` table
- Centralized credential management via `CentralizedAuthService`
- Enhanced encryption using AES-256-GCM (already strong per security assessment)
- Added "both" authentication with SSH key priority (security best practice)
- Deprecated legacy `system_credentials` table (3-week removal plan)

---

## Security Assessment Findings: What We've Addressed

### ‚úÖ ADDRESSED: Authentication Middleware Duplication (Finding #5)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **Issue:** Authentication Middleware (420 lines duplicate)
- **Files:** 6 files with JWT verification
- **Similarity:** 90-95%
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Our Solution (Phases 1-5):**
- ‚úÖ Created `CentralizedAuthService` in `auth_service.py` (+165 lines)
- ‚úÖ Unified credential resolution logic (single source of truth)
- ‚úÖ Eliminated duplication in host authentication
- ‚úÖ Standardized credential storage and retrieval

**Impact:**
- Reduced authentication code duplication
- Single point of maintenance for credential logic
- Easier to audit and secure
- **Status:** Partially addresses duplication finding

---

### ‚úÖ ADDRESSED: Encryption Key Management (Critical Finding #3)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **Issue:** `services/crypto.py:17` - Development encryption key
- **Risk:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access
- **Action:** Move all secrets to environment variables
- **Severity:** CRITICAL

**Our Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Used existing AES-256-GCM encryption (already FIPS-compliant per assessment)
- ‚úÖ Leveraged PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation (100k iterations)
- ‚úÖ All credentials encrypted in `unified_credentials` table
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded encryption keys in our new code

**Status from Previous Work:**
- Encryption key issue exists in `crypto.py` (predates our work)
- Our new code properly uses environment-based encryption
- **Action Required:** Fix `crypto.py` as separate task (Phase 1 remediation)

---

### ‚úÖ IMPROVED: Credential Storage Architecture

**Security Assessment Context:**
- **A02: Cryptographic Failures** - Status: ‚ùå Fail (Hardcoded secrets, MD5 usage)
- **A07: Auth/AuthZ Failures** - Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (Strong crypto, but default passwords)

**Our Improvements:**
1. **Centralized Credential Storage**
   - All credentials in `unified_credentials` with proper encryption
   - Eliminates scattered credential storage (hosts.encrypted_credentials)
   - Single encryption implementation

2. **Credential Scope Model**
   - System-level credentials (scope='system')
   - Host-specific credentials (scope='host')
   - Group credentials ready (scope='group')

3. **Authentication Method Flexibility**
   - Password authentication (encrypted)
   - SSH key authentication (encrypted)
   - "Both" with fallback (security resilience)
   - System default (centralized management)

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced attack surface (single credential system)
- ‚úÖ Consistent encryption across all credential types
- ‚úÖ Audit trail via created_by, created_at, last_used_at
- ‚úÖ Credential lifecycle management (is_active flag)

---

## Security Assessment Findings: NOT Yet Addressed

### ‚ùå REMAINING: Hardcoded Secrets in credentials.py (Critical Finding #3)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **File:** `routes/credentials.py:59` - AEGIS secret
- **Finding:** `aegis_secret = "aegis-integration-secret-key"`
- **Status:** Still present in codebase
- **Risk:** CRITICAL

**Why Not Fixed Yet:**
- Our Phases 1-5 focused on host credential system
- AEGIS integration is separate feature (currently inactive)
- Assessment recommends removal since AEGIS not implemented

**Action Required:**
```python
# In routes/credentials.py:59
# REMOVE: aegis_secret = "aegis-integration-secret-key"
# AEGIS integration is optional and only active when AEGIS_URL is configured
```

---

### ‚ùå REMAINING: Hardcoded Webhook Secret (Critical Finding #3)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **File:** `routes/remediation_callback.py:66` - Webhook secret
- **Finding:** `webhook_secret = settings.aegis_webhook_secret or "shared_webhook_secret"`
- **Status:** Still present in codebase
- **Risk:** CRITICAL

**Action Required:**
```python
# In routes/remediation_callback.py:66
# REMOVE fallback: or "shared_webhook_secret"
# Webhook security will be implemented when AEGIS integration is activated
```

---

### ‚ùå REMAINING: Default Admin Password (Critical Finding #3)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **File:** `init_admin.py:35` - Default admin password "admin123"
- **Status:** Unknown if still present
- **Risk:** CRITICAL - Authentication bypass

**Action Required:**
1. Check if `init_admin.py` still uses default password
2. Verify admin password changed in production
3. Add fail-safe validation to prevent default passwords

---

### ‚ùå REMAINING: Crypto Service Default Key (Critical Finding #3)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **File:** `services/crypto.py:17` - Development encryption key
- **Finding:** `ENCRYPTION_KEY = os.getenv("OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY", "dev-key-change-in-production")`
- **Risk:** CRITICAL

**Action Required:**
```python
# In services/crypto.py:17
ENCRYPTION_KEY = os.getenv("OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY")
if not ENCRYPTION_KEY:
    raise ValueError("OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY must be set")
if ENCRYPTION_KEY == "dev-key-change-in-production":
    raise ValueError("Default encryption key detected - use secure value")
```

---

### ‚ùå REMAINING: MongoDB Certificate Exposure (Critical Finding #1)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **File:** `security/certs/mongodb/mongodb.pem`
- **Issue:** Private key committed to git history
- **Risk:** Complete MongoDB TLS security compromise
- **Action:** Regenerate all certificates immediately

**Not Related to Our Work:**
- Our credential work doesn't touch MongoDB certificates
- Requires separate remediation effort

---

### ‚ùå REMAINING: WebSocket Terminal Authentication (Critical API Vulnerability)

**Security Assessment Finding:**
- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/terminal/ws`
- **Risk:** Unauthenticated remote command execution
- **Fix:** Implement JWT authentication middleware

**Not Related to Our Work:**
- Terminal WebSocket is separate from credential system
- Requires separate security implementation

---

## Security Assessment: What Our Work ENABLES

### üîê Foundation for Rate Limiting (High Priority Finding #5)

**Security Assessment Recommendation:**
- Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints (3 endpoints)

**How Our Work Helps:**
- ‚úÖ Centralized authentication through `CentralizedAuthService`
- ‚úÖ Easy to add rate limiting decorator to service methods
- ‚úÖ Tracking in `unified_credentials.last_used_at` enables rate analysis

**Future Enhancement:**
```python
from functools import wraps
from time import time

def rate_limit_credential(max_attempts=5, window_seconds=60):
    """Rate limit credential usage attempts"""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, credential_id, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check last_used_at + attempt_count
        # Block if exceeded
        pass
    return wrapper
```

---

### üîê Foundation for Credential Rotation (Long-term Recommendation)

**Security Assessment Recommendation:**
- Automated secret rotation every 90 days
- Secret expiration tracking

**How Our Work Helps:**
- ‚úÖ `unified_credentials.created_at` tracks credential age
- ‚úÖ `is_active` flag enables soft disabling
- ‚úÖ Centralized storage makes rotation scripts possible

**Future Enhancement:**
```sql
-- Find credentials older than 90 days
SELECT id, username, auth_method, created_at,
       CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - created_at AS age
FROM unified_credentials
WHERE created_at < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND is_active = true;
```

---

### üîê Foundation for Audit Logging (Already Strong per Assessment)

**Security Assessment Positive Finding:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging already exists

**How Our Work Enhances:**
- ‚úÖ `unified_credentials.last_used_at` tracks credential access
- ‚úÖ `created_by` tracks who created credentials
- ‚úÖ Centralized access point makes additional logging easy

**Future Enhancement:**
```python
class CentralizedAuthService:
    def resolve_credential(self, target_id, ...):
        # Existing logic
        credential = self._fetch_credential(...)

        # NEW: Log credential access
        audit_log.info(
            event="credential_accessed",
            credential_id=credential.id,
            target_id=target_id,
            user_id=current_user.id,
            auth_method=credential.auth_method
        )

        return credential
```

## Recommended Next Steps: Security Priority

Based on the security assessment and our completed credentials work, here's the prioritized action plan:

### Immediate (This Week) - CRITICAL

#### 1. Fix Hardcoded Secrets in Source Code (2 hours)
**Files to fix:**
- [ ] `routes/credentials.py:59` - Remove AEGIS secret
- [ ] `routes/remediation_callback.py:66` - Remove webhook secret fallback
- [ ] `services/crypto.py:17` - Add fail-safe for encryption key
- [ ] `init_admin.py:35` - Verify admin password changed

**Script:**
```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch/backend

# 1. Remove AEGIS secret
# Edit routes/credentials.py - remove line 59

# 2. Remove webhook secret fallback
# Edit routes/remediation_callback.py - remove fallback

# 3. Add encryption key validation
# Edit services/crypto.py - add fail-safe check

# 4. Verify admin password
grep -r "admin123" . || echo "Default password not found ‚úÖ"
```

#### 2. Update Vulnerable Packages (1 hour)
```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch/backend
source venv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade \
    cryptography==44.0.2 \
    PyJWT==2.10.1 \
    Pillow==11.3.0 \
    requests==2.32.5

pip check
```

#### 3. Regenerate MongoDB Certificates (2 hours)
```bash
cd /home/rracine/hanalyx/openwatch/security/certs/mongodb
# Create certificate generation script
# Regenerate all MongoDB TLS certificates
