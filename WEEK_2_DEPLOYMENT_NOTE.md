# Week 2 Backend Migration - Deployment Note

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Issue:** #110 - Backend API Migration

---

## Files Modified

### 1. backend/app/routes/credentials.py
**Status:** ⚠️ Modified in production, NOT in git (gitignored)
**Reason:** File matches `*credential*` pattern in `.gitignore`
**Location:** Deployed to Docker container only

**Changes:**
- Lines 307-338: Migrated `GET /api/v1/credentials/system/default`
- Uses `CentralizedAuthService.resolve_credential()` instead of direct SQL

**Deployment:**
```bash
docker cp backend/app/routes/credentials.py openwatch-backend:/app/backend/app/routes/credentials.py
docker-compose restart backend worker
```

**Current State:**
- ✅ Running in production (Docker container)
- ⚠️ Not committed to git (gitignore blocks it)
- ✅ Tested and verified working

---

### 2. backend/app/routes/system_settings.py
**Status:** ✅ Modified in git (tracked file)
**Changes:** Week 1 deprecation warnings (6 endpoints)

**Git Status:**
```bash
M  backend/app/routes/system_settings.py
```

**Note:** This file is the OLD system_settings (not unified).
- NOT imported in main.py (inactive)
- Has deprecation warnings from Week 1
- Can be safely committed

---

## .gitignore Issue

**Problem:**
The pattern `*credential*` in `.gitignore` (line 694) matches:
- `credentials.py` ❌ (should NOT be ignored - it's production code)
- `system_credentials_backup.sql` ✅ (should be ignored - it's data)

**Impact:**
- `credentials.py` cannot be committed to git
- Week 2 migration exists only in Docker container
- Git history doesn't reflect current production state

**Recommendation for Future:**
Update `.gitignore` to be more specific:
```gitignore
# Before (too broad):
*credential*

# After (more specific):
*_credential*.sql
system_credentials_backup.sql
**/credentials.json
**/credentials.yml
```

But keep route files trackable:
```gitignore
# Don't ignore route files
!backend/app/routes/credentials.py
```

## What Was Committed Previously

**Last relevant commit:** `e27609b`
```
Implement unified credentials system with "both" authentication
```

**Files included:**
- backend/app/services/auth_service.py
- backend/app/services/host_monitor.py
- backend/app/services/unified_ssh_service.py
- frontend/src/pages/hosts/AddHost.tsx
- backend/app/routes/hosts.py
- .github/workflows/deprecation-monitor.yml

**Missing from that commit:**
- backend/app/routes/credentials.py (was gitignored)

---

## Current Production State

**What's Running:**
- ✅ credentials.py with Week 2 migration (CentralizedAuthService)
- ✅ system_settings_unified.py (already using CentralizedAuthService)
- ✅ All 7 endpoints query unified_credentials table
- ✅ All hosts online, zero errors

**What's in Git:**
- ⚠️ credentials.py NOT in git (gitignored)
- ✅ system_settings.py (old file with deprecation warnings)
- ✅ system_settings_unified.py (active file)

**Discrepancy:**
Production (Docker) ≠ Git repository for credentials.py

---

## Workaround Applied

Since credentials.py is gitignored:

1. **Production Deployment:** ✅ Done
   - File copied to Docker container
   - Backend restarted successfully
   - Verified working in production

2. **Git Commit:** ⏸️ Skipped
   - Cannot commit due to gitignore
   - Would require gitignore modification
   - Outside scope of current task

3. **Documentation:** ✅ Done
   - Week 2 migration documented
   - Production state documented
   - This note explains the discrepancy

---

## Recommendation

**Option A: Force add credentials.py (if allowed)**
```bash
git add -f backend/app/routes/credentials.py
git commit -m "Week 2: Migrate credentials.py to use unified_credentials"
```

**Option B: Update .gitignore first**
```bash
# Edit .gitignore to not match route files
git add .gitignore
git add backend/app/routes/credentials.py
git commit -m "Week 2: Fix gitignore and commit credentials.py migration"
```

**Option C: Accept current state (chosen for now)**
- Keep credentials.py deployment in Docker only
- Document the discrepancy
- Address in Week 3 cleanup

---

## Week 2 Status Despite Git Issue

**Backend Migration:** ✅ COMPLETE
- All 7 endpoints migrated
- All endpoints use unified_credentials
- Production tested and verified
- Zero breaking changes

**Git Status:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- credentials.py not in git (gitignored)
- Week 2 migration not in git history
- Documentation files not committed (by design)

**Conclusion:**
Week 2 backend migration is **functionally complete** in production, but git repository doesn't reflect the full state due to overly broad gitignore pattern.
