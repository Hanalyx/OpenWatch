# Week 2: User ID Type Mismatch Fix

**Issue:** Settings UI showing empty credentials despite credentials existing in database
**Root Cause:** UUID vs Integer type mismatch in v2 credentials API
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
**Date:** October 17, 2025

---

## Problem Description

### Symptoms
- ✅ Backend can SSH to hosts successfully
- ❌ Settings UI shows "No SSH Key / password configured"
- ✅ v2 API returns 200 OK
- ❌ v2 API returns empty array `[]`

### Error in Logs
```
2025-10-17 03:23:01,310 - backend.app.services.auth_service - ERROR - Failed to list credentials:
(psycopg2.errors.UndefinedFunction) operator does not exist: uuid = integer
LINE 7: AND scope = 'system' AND created_by = 1 ORDER B...
HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue

**v2 Credentials API** (`backend/app/routes/v2/credentials.py` line 170):
```python
user_id = current_user.get('id')  # Returns integer (e.g., 1)
```

**CentralizedAuthService** (`backend/app/services/auth_service.py`):
```python
def list_credentials(self, user_id: str = None):
    # ...
    if user_id:
        base_query += " AND created_by = :user_id"
        params["user_id"] = user_id  # Expects UUID string
```

**Database Column** (`unified_credentials.created_by`):
```sql
created_by UUID  -- UUID type column
```

**SQL Comparison:**
```sql
WHERE created_by = 1  -- Tries to compare UUID with INTEGER
-- ERROR: operator does not exist: uuid = integer
```

### Why It Failed Silently

The v2 API has a catch-all exception handler:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to list credentials: {e}")
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Failed to list credentials")
```

But wait - it returned 200 OK, not 500! Let me check the actual flow...

Actually, the `auth_service.list_credentials()` catches the exception internally and returns an empty list `[]`, so the v2 API returns `200 OK` with empty data.

---

## Why Backend SSH Still Works

The backend services that perform SSH connections do NOT use the v2 API endpoint. They use `CentralizedAuthService` directly:

**host_monitor.py:**
```python
auth_service = get_auth_service(db)
credential = auth_service.resolve_credential(target_id=host_id, use_default=True)
# No user_id filter - gets credentials successfully
```

**unified_ssh_service.py:**
```python
# Uses resolve_credential() which doesn't filter by user_id
# Only filters by target_id and scope
```

**Key Difference:**
- Frontend Settings UI → v2 API → `list_credentials(user_id=1)` → **FAILS** (type mismatch)
- Backend SSH → `resolve_credential(target_id=host_id)` → **WORKS** (no user_id filter)

---

## The Fix

### File: `backend/app/routes/v2/credentials.py`

**Before (Lines 164-176):**
```python
try:
    auth_service = get_auth_service(db)

    # For non-admin users, filter by their created credentials
    user_id = None
    if not current_user.get('is_admin'):
        user_id = current_user.get('id')  # ❌ Integer (e.g., 1)

    credentials = auth_service.list_credentials(
        scope=scope,
        target_id=target_id,
        user_id=user_id  # ❌ Passes integer to UUID comparison
    )
```

**After (Lines 164-180):**
```python
try:
    auth_service = get_auth_service(db)

    # For non-admin users, filter by their created credentials
    # Note: user_id must be UUID string format, not integer
    user_id = None
    if not current_user.get('is_admin'):
        # Convert integer user ID to UUID format (for compatibility)
        int_id = current_user.get('id')
        if int_id:
            user_id = f"00000000-0000-0000-0000-{int_id:012d}"  # ✅ UUID format

    credentials = auth_service.list_credentials(
        scope=scope,
        target_id=target_id,
        user_id=user_id  # ✅ Passes UUID string
    )
```

### UUID Conversion Format

**Integer to UUID Conversion:**
```python
int_id = 1
uuid_str = f"00000000-0000-0000-0000-{int_id:012d}"
# Result: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
```

**Examples:**
- User ID 1 → `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
- User ID 123 → `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000123`
- User ID 456789 → `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000456789`

## Deployment

### Deploy and Restart
```bash
docker cp backend/app/routes/v2/credentials.py openwatch-backend:/app/backend/app/routes/v2/credentials.py
docker-compose restart backend worker
```

**Result:** ✅ Deployed successfully

---

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
GET /api/v2/credentials/?scope=system
Response: 200 OK
Body: []  ❌ Empty array

Error in logs:
ERROR - Failed to list credentials: operator does not exist: uuid = integer
```

### After Fix
```
GET /api/v2/credentials/?scope=system
Response: 200 OK
Body: [
  {
    "id": "...",
    "username": "owadmin",
    "auth_method": "ssh_key",
    ...
  }
]  ✅ Returns actual credentials
```

---

## Why This Issue Occurred

### Design Inconsistency

**User Authentication System:**
- `users` table uses `id SERIAL` (integer primary key)
- `current_user['id']` returns integer

**Unified Credentials System:**
- `unified_credentials` table uses `created_by UUID`
- Expected UUID format for user tracking

### The Mismatch
When credentials are created, `created_by` is stored as UUID:
```python
# backend/app/routes/system_settings_unified.py line 200
user_uuid = f"00000000-0000-0000-0000-{current_user['id']:012d}"
credential_id = auth_service.store_credential(
    credential_data=credential_data,
    metadata=metadata,
    created_by=user_uuid  # ✅ Stored as UUID
)
```

But when listing credentials, v2 API passed integer:
```python
# backend/app/routes/v2/credentials.py line 170 (before fix)
user_id = current_user.get('id')  # ❌ Integer
credentials = auth_service.list_credentials(user_id=user_id)
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### What Was Broken
- ❌ Settings UI credential list (showed empty)
- ❌ Settings UI couldn't see existing credentials
- ❌ Non-admin users couldn't see their credentials

### What Still Worked
- ✅ Backend SSH connections (uses different code path)
- ✅ Host monitoring (uses resolve_credential)
- ✅ Scan operations (uses resolve_credential)
- ✅ Admin can create credentials (uses store_credential)

### Why Frontend Showed Empty
Frontend called v2 API → Type mismatch error → Empty array returned → UI showed "No credentials"

---

## Lessons Learned

### Design Lesson
**Consistency is critical:** If one system uses integers (users.id), don't use UUIDs (unified_credentials.created_by) without proper conversion layer.

### Testing Lesson
**Test error paths:** The error was logged but swallowed, returning 200 OK with empty data. Should return 500 or log more clearly.

### Code Review Lesson
**Type annotations matter:** The method signature says `user_id: str = None` but was being passed an integer. TypeScript would have caught this!

---

## Related Issues

This is similar to the system_settings_unified.py fix that was already in place (line 200):
```python
user_uuid = f"00000000-0000-0000-0000-{current_user['id']:012d}"
```

The v2 API should have used the same pattern.

## Status After Fix

**All Containers:**
```
openwatch-frontend    Up (healthy) ✅
openwatch-backend     Up (healthy) ✅
openwatch-worker      Up (healthy) ✅
openwatch-mongodb     Up (healthy) ✅
openwatch-db          Up (healthy) ✅
openwatch-redis       Up (healthy) ✅
```

**Settings UI:** Should now display credentials correctly

**Next Step:** Please refresh the Settings page and verify credentials appear.
