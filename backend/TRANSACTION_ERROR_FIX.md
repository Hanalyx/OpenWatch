# Transaction Error Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Identified

**Error in Production Logs:**
```
ERROR - Error getting setting ssh_host_key_policy:
(psycopg2.errors.InFailedSqlTransaction) current transaction is aborted,
commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

**Impact:** When a database query failed, the transaction remained in an aborted state, causing all subsequent queries in that transaction to fail until the transaction was rolled back.

---

## Root Cause

In `unified_ssh_service.py`, the `get_setting()` method caught exceptions but **did not rollback the database transaction**:

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
def get_setting(self, key: str, default: Any = None) -> Any:
    try:
        setting = self.db.query(SystemSettings).filter(
            SystemSettings.setting_key == key
        ).first()
        # ... process setting ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting setting {key}: {e}")
        return default  # ❌ Transaction left in failed state!
```

**What happened:**
1. Database query fails (e.g., table doesn't exist, constraint violation)
2. Exception is caught and logged
3. Method returns default value
4. **Transaction is NOT rolled back**
5. Next database query in same transaction fails with `InFailedSqlTransaction`

---

## Fix Applied

Added `db.rollback()` in the exception handler:

```python
# AFTER (fixed):
def get_setting(self, key: str, default: Any = None) -> Any:
    try:
        setting = self.db.query(SystemSettings).filter(
            SystemSettings.setting_key == key
        ).first()
        # ... process setting ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting setting {key}: {e}")
        # Rollback transaction on error to prevent "aborted transaction" state
        if self.db:
            self.db.rollback()  # ✅ Transaction properly cleaned up
        return default
```

---

## File Modified

**File:** `backend/app/services/unified_ssh_service.py`
**Lines:** 1019-1022
**Change:** Added transaction rollback in exception handler

```diff
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error(f"Error getting setting {key}: {e}")
+     # Rollback transaction on error to prevent "aborted transaction" state
+     if self.db:
+         self.db.rollback()
      return default
```

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
openwatch-backend | ERROR - Error getting setting ssh_host_key_policy:
(psycopg2.errors.InFailedSqlTransaction) current transaction is aborted,
commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ docker logs openwatch-backend --tail 30
2025-10-10 03:24:57 - INFO - MongoDB integration service initialized successfully
2025-10-10 03:24:59 - INFO - ✅ Database health check successful
2025-10-10 03:24:59 - INFO - ✅ Redis health check successful
2025-10-10 03:24:59 - INFO - ✅ MongoDB health check successful
INFO: 172.20.0.1 - "GET /api/hosts/ HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

✅ **No transaction errors**
✅ **System running cleanly**
✅ **All health checks passing**

## Why This Matters

**PostgreSQL Transaction Behavior:**
- PostgreSQL uses strict transaction semantics
- When a query fails within a transaction, the entire transaction enters an "aborted" state
- All subsequent commands are ignored until `ROLLBACK` or `COMMIT`
- This is different from MySQL which has more lenient transaction handling

**Impact of Not Rolling Back:**
1. One failed query contaminates the entire transaction
2. All subsequent queries fail with `InFailedSqlTransaction`
3. System appears broken even though individual queries are valid
4. Hard to debug because error message doesn't indicate original failure

---

## Pattern to Follow

**All database exception handlers should rollback:**

```python
try:
    # Database operations
    result = db.query(Model).filter(...).first()
    db.commit()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
    if db:
        db.rollback()  # ✅ Always rollback on error
    # Handle error appropriately
```

---

## Other Methods Checked

Reviewed all exception handlers in `unified_ssh_service.py`:
- ✅ `set_setting()` - Already had rollback (line 1071)
- ✅ `get_setting()` - Now has rollback (line 1021)
- ℹ️ Other exception handlers don't use database

---

## Deployment

**Applied to Running Container:**
```bash
docker cp backend/app/services/unified_ssh_service.py openwatch-backend:/app/backend/app/services/
docker-compose restart backend worker
```

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and verified in production
