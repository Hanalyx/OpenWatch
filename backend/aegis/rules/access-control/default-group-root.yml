title: Ensure default group for root is GID 0
description: >
  The default group for the root user must be GID 0 (root group) to ensure
  proper access controls and file ownership.
rationale: >
  Having a default group other than GID 0 for root could lead to files
  being created with unexpected group ownership, potentially allowing
  unauthorized access.
