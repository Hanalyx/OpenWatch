title: Set minimum password age
description: >
  The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs defines the minimum number
  of days before a password may be changed after it was last set.
rationale: >
  A minimum password age prevents users from immediately changing their password
  back to a previous value, which would defeat password history requirements.
  A value of 1 day is recommended.
