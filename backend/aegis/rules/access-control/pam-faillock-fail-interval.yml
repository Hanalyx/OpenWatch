title: Set failed login counting interval
description: >
  The fail_interval parameter in /etc/security/faillock.conf sets the
  interval in seconds during which failed login attempts are counted.
rationale: >
  Setting a fail interval ensures that failed login attempts are counted
  within a defined window. This prevents attackers from spreading out
  brute-force attempts over a long period to avoid lockout.
