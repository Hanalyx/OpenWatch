title: Require digit in password
description: >
  The dcredit parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf controls the credit
  given for having digits in the password. A negative value requires at least
  that many digits.
rationale: >
  Requiring digits increases password complexity and makes passwords more
  resistant to dictionary attacks.
