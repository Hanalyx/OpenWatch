title: Enable dictionary check for passwords
description: >
  The dictcheck parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf enables checking
  whether passwords are based on dictionary words.
rationale: >
  Dictionary words and common phrases are easily guessed by attackers using
  dictionary attacks. Enabling dictionary checking prevents users from
  using weak passwords based on common words.
