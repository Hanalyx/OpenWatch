title: Require changed characters from previous password
description: >
  The difok parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf sets the minimum
  number of characters that must differ from the previous password.
rationale: >
  Requiring a minimum number of changed characters prevents users from
  making trivial changes to their existing password, such as incrementing
  a number at the end.
