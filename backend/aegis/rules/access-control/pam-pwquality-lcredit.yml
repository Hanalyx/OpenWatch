title: Require lowercase character in password
description: >
  The lcredit parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf controls the credit
  given for having lowercase characters in the password. A negative value
  requires at least that many lowercase characters.
rationale: >
  Requiring lowercase characters increases password complexity and makes
  passwords more resistant to dictionary attacks.
