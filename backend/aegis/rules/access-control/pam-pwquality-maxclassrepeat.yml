title: Limit consecutive characters from same class
description: >
  The maxclassrepeat parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf sets the
  maximum number of allowed consecutive characters from the same character
  class (digits, uppercase, lowercase, special).
rationale: >
  Limiting consecutive characters from the same class prevents weak patterns
  like "ABCD" or "1234" and ensures better character distribution in passwords.
