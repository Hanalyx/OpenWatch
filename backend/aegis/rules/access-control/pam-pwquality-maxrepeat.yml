title: Limit consecutive repeating characters in password
description: >
  The maxrepeat parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf sets the maximum
  number of allowed consecutive same characters in a password.
rationale: >
  Limiting consecutive repeating characters prevents weak patterns like
  "aaaa" or "1111" in passwords, increasing resistance to pattern-based
  attacks.
