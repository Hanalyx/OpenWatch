title: Require minimum character classes in password
description: >
  The minclass parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf sets the minimum
  number of character classes (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special) that
  must be present in a password.
rationale: >
  Requiring multiple character classes ensures password diversity and makes
  passwords more resistant to attacks. A minimum of 4 classes provides
  strong protection.
