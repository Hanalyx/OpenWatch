title: Set minimum password length
description: >
  The minlen parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf sets the minimum
  acceptable size for new passwords. Longer passwords are more resistant
  to brute-force attacks.
rationale: >
  Password length is one of the most important factors in password strength.
  A minimum of 14 characters is recommended for strong security.
