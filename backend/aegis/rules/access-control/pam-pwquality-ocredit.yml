title: Require special character in password
description: >
  The ocredit parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf controls the credit
  given for having special (other) characters in the password. A negative value
  requires at least that many special characters.
rationale: >
  Requiring special characters significantly increases password complexity
  and makes passwords more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
