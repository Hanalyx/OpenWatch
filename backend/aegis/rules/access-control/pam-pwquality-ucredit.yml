title: Require uppercase character in password
description: >
  The ucredit parameter in /etc/security/pwquality.conf controls the credit
  given for having uppercase characters in the password. A negative value
  requires at least that many uppercase characters.
rationale: >
  Requiring uppercase characters increases password complexity and makes
  passwords more resistant to dictionary attacks.
