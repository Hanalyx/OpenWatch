title: Ensure root account has GID 0
description: >
  The root account must have GID 0 to ensure proper access to system files
  and maintain expected behavior of privileged operations.
rationale: >
  The root account with GID 0 has special privileges. If root has a different
  GID, it could lead to unexpected access control behavior or security issues.
