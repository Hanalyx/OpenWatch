title: Configure SSH warning banner
description: >
  The SSH daemon must display a warning banner before authentication. The
  Banner directive specifies a file whose contents are sent to connecting
  clients prior to authentication, providing legal notice that the system
  is monitored and unauthorized access is prohibited.

rationale: >
  A pre-authentication banner establishes the legal basis for monitoring
  and prosecution of unauthorized access. Without a warning banner, an
  attacker may claim they were unaware the system was restricted, weakening
  the organization's legal standing in the event of a security incident or
  prosecution.
