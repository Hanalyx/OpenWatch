title: Set SSH client alive count maximum
description: >
  The SSH daemon must terminate sessions after a defined number of missed
  keepalive responses. ClientAliveCountMax sets how many client-alive
  messages can be sent without receiving a response before the server
  disconnects the session.

rationale: >
  A high ClientAliveCountMax allows sessions to persist long after the
  client has become unresponsive, leaving open sessions that an attacker
  could hijack. Setting the count to 1 ensures that a session is terminated
  promptly after the first missed keepalive, working in conjunction with
  ClientAliveInterval to enforce a strict idle timeout.
