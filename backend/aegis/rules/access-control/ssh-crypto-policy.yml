title: Ensure SSH uses system-wide crypto policy
description: >
  The SSH daemon must not override the system-wide cryptographic policy.
  RHEL systems use update-crypto-policies to enforce consistent
  cryptographic standards across all services. Manual Ciphers, MACs, or
  KexAlgorithms directives in sshd_config bypass this centralized control.

rationale: >
  Overriding the system crypto policy in sshd_config can introduce weak
  algorithms that the system administrator has intentionally disabled. An
  attacker could exploit a manually configured weak cipher or MAC algorithm
  to decrypt or tamper with SSH traffic, defeating the protections that the
  system-wide crypto policy was designed to enforce.
