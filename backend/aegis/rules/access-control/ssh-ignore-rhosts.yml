title: Disable SSH rhosts-based authentication
description: >
  The SSH daemon must ignore .rhosts and .shosts files for host-based
  authentication. These legacy trust files allow users to specify remote
  hosts and users that should be granted access without a password.

rationale: >
  The .rhosts mechanism is a legacy trust model that relies on hostname and
  username matching without cryptographic verification. An attacker who can
  create or modify a user's .rhosts file can establish password-free access
  from arbitrary hosts, completely bypassing authentication controls.
