title: Disable SSH user known hosts for host-based auth
description: >
  The SSH daemon must ignore user-level known_hosts files when performing
  host-based authentication. The IgnoreUserKnownHosts directive prevents
  sshd from trusting host keys cached in individual user home directories
  for host-based authentication decisions.

rationale: >
  User-managed known_hosts files can be modified to trust arbitrary hosts.
  An attacker who gains write access to a user's .ssh/known_hosts file
  could add a malicious host's key, causing the server to accept host-based
  authentication from attacker-controlled systems.
