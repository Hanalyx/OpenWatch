title: Set SSH login grace time
description: >
  The SSH daemon must disconnect clients that have not completed
  authentication within a defined time period. LoginGraceTime sets the
  maximum number of seconds allowed for a client to authenticate before
  the server terminates the connection.

rationale: >
  A long or unlimited login grace period allows an attacker to hold open
  unauthenticated connections indefinitely, consuming daemon resources and
  potentially facilitating denial-of-service attacks. Setting the grace
  time to 60 seconds or less ensures abandoned or malicious connections
  are promptly reclaimed.
