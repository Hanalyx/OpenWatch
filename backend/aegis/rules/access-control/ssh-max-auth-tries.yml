title: Limit SSH maximum authentication attempts
description: >
  The SSH daemon must limit the number of authentication attempts permitted
  per connection. MaxAuthTries restricts how many times a client can attempt
  to authenticate before the connection is dropped, reducing the
  effectiveness of brute-force attacks.

rationale: >
  Without a limit on authentication attempts, an attacker can make an
  unlimited number of password guesses within a single SSH connection.
  Setting MaxAuthTries to 4 or fewer forces the attacker to establish a new
  connection for each set of attempts, making brute-force attacks slower
  and more detectable by intrusion detection systems.
