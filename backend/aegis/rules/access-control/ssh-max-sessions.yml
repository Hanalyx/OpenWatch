title: Limit SSH maximum concurrent sessions
description: >
  The SSH daemon must limit the number of concurrent sessions permitted per
  network connection. MaxSessions controls session multiplexing, which
  allows multiple logical sessions over a single TCP connection.

rationale: >
  Unlimited session multiplexing allows a single authenticated connection
  to spawn many sessions, which can be used to amplify the impact of a
  compromised credential. An attacker with one valid login can open
  numerous simultaneous sessions for parallel data exfiltration or to
  consume system resources.
