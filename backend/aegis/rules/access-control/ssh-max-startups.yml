title: Limit SSH unauthenticated connection startups
description: >
  The SSH daemon must limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated
  connections. MaxStartups uses a start:rate:full format that begins
  randomly dropping connections once a threshold is reached, preventing
  connection-flooding denial-of-service attacks.

rationale: >
  Without startup limits, an attacker can open thousands of unauthenticated
  SSH connections simultaneously, exhausting the daemon's connection slots
  and preventing legitimate users from connecting. The 10:30:60 setting
  begins dropping new connections with 30% probability after 10 pending
  connections, reaching 100% refusal at 60.
