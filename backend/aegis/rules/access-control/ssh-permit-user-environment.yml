title: Disable SSH user environment processing
description: >
  The SSH daemon must not process environment variables from user-controlled
  files such as ~/.ssh/environment. When enabled, users can inject arbitrary
  environment variables that may alter the behavior of shell sessions and
  system commands.

rationale: >
  User environment processing allows an attacker who has compromised an SSH
  authorized key to inject environment variables such as LD_PRELOAD or PATH
  overrides, enabling privilege escalation or execution of malicious code
  within the session context.
