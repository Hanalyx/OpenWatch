title: Enable SSH public key authentication
description: >
  The SSH daemon must support public key authentication as a primary
  authentication method. Public key authentication uses asymmetric
  cryptography to verify client identity without transmitting credentials
  over the network.

rationale: >
  Public key authentication is significantly more resistant to brute-force
  attacks than password-based authentication because private keys are
  cryptographically infeasible to guess. Disabling this method forces
  reliance on weaker authentication mechanisms, increasing the risk of
  credential theft and unauthorized access.
