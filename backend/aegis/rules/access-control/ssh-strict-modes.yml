title: Enable SSH strict mode checking
description: >
  The SSH daemon must verify the ownership and permissions of the user's
  home directory, authorized_keys file, and related configuration before
  accepting a login. StrictModes ensures that improperly secured files
  cannot be used to gain unauthorized access.

rationale: >
  Without strict mode checking, an attacker who gains write access to a
  user's home directory or .ssh folder could inject their own public key
  into the authorized_keys file and authenticate as that user. StrictModes
  prevents this by rejecting keys stored in files with overly permissive
  ownership or permissions.
