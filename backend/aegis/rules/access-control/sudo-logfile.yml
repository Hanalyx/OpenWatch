title: Ensure sudo commands are logged
description: >
  The logfile option in sudoers configuration specifies a file where sudo
  will log all sudo commands. This provides an audit trail of privileged
  command execution.

  Logging sudo commands provides accountability and allows administrators
  to track privileged access. This is essential for incident response and
  compliance auditing.
