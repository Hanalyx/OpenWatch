title: Ensure AIDE monitors audit tools
description: >
  AIDE should be configured to monitor the integrity of audit tools
  including auditctl, auditd, ausearch, aureport, autrace, and rsyslogd.
rationale: >
  Attackers may attempt to modify audit tools to hide their activities.
  Monitoring these binaries ensures tampering attempts are detected.

        Add audit tools to AIDE configuration. Add lines to /etc/aide.conf
        such as '/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512' for each
        audit binary. Then regenerate the AIDE database with 'aide --init'.
