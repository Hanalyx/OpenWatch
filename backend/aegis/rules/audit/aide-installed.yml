title: Install and initialize AIDE
description: >
  AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) must be installed and its
  database initialized to provide filesystem integrity monitoring. AIDE detects
  unauthorized modifications to system files.
rationale: >
  Without file integrity monitoring, unauthorized modifications to critical
  system files (binaries, libraries, configuration) may go undetected. AIDE
  provides a baseline against which changes are compared.
