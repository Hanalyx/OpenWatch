title: Audit file ownership changes
description: >
  The system must audit all uses of the chown, fchown, fchownat, and
  lchown system calls to track ownership changes.
rationale: >
  Unauthorized ownership changes could allow attackers to take control
  of system files. Auditing ownership changes provides accountability
  and helps detect unauthorized modifications.
