title: Set permissions on audit log directory
description: >
  The /var/log/audit directory must have restrictive permissions (0700 or
  more restrictive) to prevent unauthorized access to audit logs.
rationale: >
  Audit logs contain sensitive security information about system activity.
  Unrestricted access could allow attackers to read logs to understand
  detection capabilities or modify/delete logs to cover their tracks.
