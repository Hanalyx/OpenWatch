title: Audit mount and unmount operations
description: >
  The system must audit all mount and unmount operations to track
  filesystem changes.
rationale: >
  Unauthorized mounts could be used to access data or bypass security
  controls. Auditing mount operations provides visibility into filesystem
  changes and potential attack attempts.
