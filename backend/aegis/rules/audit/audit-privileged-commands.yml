title: Audit execution of privileged commands
description: >
  The system must audit all executions of setuid and setgid programs
  to track privileged command usage.
rationale: >
  Privileged commands run with elevated permissions and are common
  targets for attackers. Auditing their execution provides accountability
  and helps detect unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
