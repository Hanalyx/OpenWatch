title: Configure auditd disk_full_action
description: >
  The auditd daemon must halt the system when the audit storage disk
  is full to prevent loss of audit data.
rationale: >
  When audit storage is completely full, the system must halt to prevent
  security events from going unrecorded. This ensures audit continuity
  for compliance and forensics.
