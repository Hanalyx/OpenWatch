title: Audit SGID executables
description: >
  SGID (Set Group ID) executables run with the file group's privileges.
  The list of SGID files should be reviewed regularly to ensure no
  unauthorized SGID binaries exist.
rationale: >
  SGID binaries can be exploited to gain group-level privileges. Regular
  auditing ensures only authorized programs have SGID set and helps
  detect potential privilege escalation vectors.

        Review SGID files and remove SGID bit from unauthorized programs:
        find / -xdev -type f -perm -2000
        Compare against a known-good baseline. Remove SGID if not needed:
        chmod g-s <file>
