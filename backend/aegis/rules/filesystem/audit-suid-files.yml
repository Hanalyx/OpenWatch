title: Audit SUID executables
description: >
  SUID (Set User ID) executables run with the file owner's privileges.
  The list of SUID files should be reviewed regularly to ensure no
  unauthorized SUID binaries exist.
rationale: >
  SUID binaries can be exploited to gain elevated privileges. Regular
  auditing ensures only authorized programs have SUID set and helps
  detect potential privilege escalation vectors.

        Review SUID files and remove SUID bit from unauthorized programs:
        find / -xdev -type f -perm -4000
        Compare against a known-good baseline. Remove SUID if not needed:
        chmod u-s <file>
