title: Set permissions on /etc/shadow
description: >
  The /etc/shadow file contains hashed passwords. It must be readable only by
  root to prevent offline password cracking attacks.
rationale: >
  If /etc/shadow is world-readable, any local user can copy the password hashes
  and run offline brute-force attacks. Restricting access to root-only eliminates
  this vector entirely.
