title: Ensure nodev option on /dev/shm partition
description: >
  The nodev mount option prevents device files from being interpreted on
  /dev/shm. This shared memory filesystem should not contain device files.
rationale: >
  Allowing device files on /dev/shm could allow creation of special devices
  that access hardware directly.
