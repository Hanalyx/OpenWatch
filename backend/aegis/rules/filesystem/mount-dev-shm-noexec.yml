title: Ensure noexec option on /dev/shm partition
description: >
  The noexec mount option prevents execution of binaries on /dev/shm.
  This prevents attackers from executing code from shared memory.
rationale: >
  Shared memory is sometimes used by attackers to stage and execute malicious
  code. Preventing execution blocks this attack vector.
