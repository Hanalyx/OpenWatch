title: Ensure nosuid option on /dev/shm partition
description: >
  The nosuid mount option prevents setuid/setgid bits from being honored on
  /dev/shm. This prevents privilege escalation via shared memory.
rationale: >
  Setuid programs in shared memory could be used for privilege escalation
  attacks.
