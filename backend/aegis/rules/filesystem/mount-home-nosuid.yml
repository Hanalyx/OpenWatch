title: Ensure nosuid option on /home partition
description: >
  The nosuid mount option prevents setuid/setgid bits from being honored on
  /home. Users should not be able to create setuid programs in their home.
rationale: >
  Setuid programs in /home could be used for privilege escalation if a user
  can trick another user or root into executing them.
