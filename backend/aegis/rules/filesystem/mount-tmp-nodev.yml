title: Ensure nodev option on /tmp partition
description: >
  The nodev mount option prevents device files from being interpreted on the
  /tmp filesystem. Device files should only exist in /dev.
rationale: >
  Allowing device files on /tmp could allow an attacker to create block or
  character special devices that could be used to access hardware directly.
