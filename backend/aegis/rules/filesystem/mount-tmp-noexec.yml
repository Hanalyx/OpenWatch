title: Ensure noexec option on /tmp partition
description: >
  The noexec mount option prevents execution of binaries on the /tmp filesystem.
  This prevents attackers from executing malicious code placed in /tmp.
rationale: >
  Attackers often drop and execute malicious binaries in /tmp because it is
  world-writable. Preventing execution blocks this attack vector.
