title: Ensure nosuid option on /tmp partition
description: >
  The nosuid mount option prevents setuid and setgid bits from being honored
  on the /tmp filesystem. This prevents privilege escalation via setuid programs.
rationale: >
  Allowing setuid programs on /tmp could allow an attacker to create malicious
  setuid programs that escalate privileges when executed by other users.
