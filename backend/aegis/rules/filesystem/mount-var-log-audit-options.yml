title: Set mount options on /var/log/audit
description: >
  The /var/log/audit partition should have nodev, nosuid, and noexec
  mount options set to prevent device files, setuid binaries, and
  executable files in the audit log directory.
rationale: >
  Restrictive mount options on /var/log/audit prevent execution of
  malicious code that might be placed in log files and limit potential
  privilege escalation vectors.
