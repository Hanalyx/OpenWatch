title: Set mount options on /var/log
description: >
  The /var/log partition should have nodev, nosuid, and noexec
  mount options set to prevent device files, setuid binaries, and
  executable files in the log directory.
rationale: >
  Restrictive mount options on /var/log prevent execution of
  malicious code that might be placed in or disguised as log files
  and limit privilege escalation vectors.
