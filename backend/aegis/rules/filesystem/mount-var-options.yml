title: Set mount options on /var
description: >
  The /var partition should have nodev mount option set to prevent
  device files in the /var directory tree.
rationale: >
  The /var filesystem contains variable data including logs and caches.
  The nodev option prevents interpretation of block or character
  special devices, reducing potential attack vectors.
