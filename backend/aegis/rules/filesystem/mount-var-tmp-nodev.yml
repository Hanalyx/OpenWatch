title: Ensure nodev option on /var/tmp partition
description: >
  The nodev mount option prevents device files from being interpreted on
  /var/tmp. Device files should only exist in /dev.
rationale: >
  Allowing device files on /var/tmp could allow an attacker to create special
  devices that access hardware directly.
