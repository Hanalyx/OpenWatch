title: Ensure noexec option on /var/tmp partition
description: >
  The noexec mount option prevents execution of binaries on /var/tmp.
  This prevents attackers from executing malicious code.
rationale: >
  Preventing execution on /var/tmp blocks a common attack vector where
  malicious code is dropped and executed from world-writable directories.
