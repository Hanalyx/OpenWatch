title: Ensure no .forward files exist
description: >
  The .forward file in user home directories allows users to forward
  their mail to external addresses. These files should not exist on
  most systems.
rationale: >
  Forward files can be used to exfiltrate data or redirect sensitive
  information to external addresses. On systems where mail forwarding
  is not required, these files pose an unnecessary risk.

      note: >
        Review and remove .forward files from user home directories.
        Use 'find /home -name .forward -type f' to locate files.
        Verify each file with the user before removal as they may
        have legitimate mail forwarding requirements.
