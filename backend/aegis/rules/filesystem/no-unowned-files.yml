  Files without a valid owner (user) may indicate deleted user accounts
  or improperly installed software and should be investigated.
rationale: >
  Unowned files could have been left behind by deleted users and may
  contain sensitive data or be exploitable. They should be assigned
  to an appropriate owner or removed.
