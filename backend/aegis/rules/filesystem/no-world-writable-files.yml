title: Audit world-writable files
description: >
  World-writable files can be modified by any user on the system and
  represent a security risk. Such files should be audited and permissions
  corrected.
rationale: >
  World-writable files could be modified by attackers to inject malicious
  code or data. Regular auditing ensures no unauthorized world-writable
  files exist.

        Review and remove world-writable permissions from files:
        find / -xdev -type f -perm -0002 -exec chmod o-w {} \;
        Investigate each file to ensure the change won't break applications.
