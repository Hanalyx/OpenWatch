title: Set sticky bit on world-writable directories
description: >
  World-writable directories should have the sticky bit set to prevent
  users from deleting or renaming files owned by other users.
rationale: >
  Without the sticky bit, any user can delete or rename files in a
  world-writable directory, even files they don't own. The sticky bit
  ensures only the file owner can delete their files.
