title: Disable cramfs kernel module
description: >
  The cramfs filesystem is a read-only compressed filesystem. It is rarely
  needed on production systems and provides an unnecessary attack surface
  for kernel-level exploits.
rationale: >
  Removing support for unnecessary filesystems reduces the kernel attack surface.
  A vulnerability in an unused filesystem module could be exploited if the module
  is loadable.
