title: Disable DCCP kernel module
description: >
  The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) kernel module should
  be disabled if not required.
rationale: >
  DCCP is a transport protocol that is rarely used on most systems.
  Disabling unused protocols reduces the attack surface and potential
  for exploitation of protocol vulnerabilities.
