title: Disable FireWire kernel module
description: >
  The FireWire (IEEE 1394) kernel module should be disabled if FireWire
  devices are not used.
rationale: >
  FireWire provides direct memory access (DMA) which can be exploited
  by attackers with physical access to read or write system memory,
  potentially compromising the system.
