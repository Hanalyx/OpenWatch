title: Disable hfs kernel module
description: >
  The hfs filesystem is the Apple Hierarchical File System. It is rarely needed
  on production Linux systems and provides an unnecessary attack surface.
rationale: >
  Removing support for unnecessary filesystems reduces the kernel attack surface.
  A vulnerability in an unused filesystem module could be exploited if loadable.
