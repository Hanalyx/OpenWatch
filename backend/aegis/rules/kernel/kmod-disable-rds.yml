title: Disable RDS kernel module
description: >
  The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) kernel module should be disabled
  if not required.
rationale: >
  RDS is a high-performance transport protocol rarely used on most systems.
  Disabling unused protocols reduces the attack surface and potential
  for exploitation of protocol vulnerabilities.
