title: Disable IPv4 forwarding
description: >
  IP forwarding allows the system to act as a router, forwarding packets between
  network interfaces. On systems that are not designated routers, this must be
  disabled to prevent the system from being used to redirect network traffic.
rationale: >
  An attacker could use a compromised host with IP forwarding enabled to route
  traffic between otherwise segmented networks, bypassing firewall controls and
  enabling lateral movement.
