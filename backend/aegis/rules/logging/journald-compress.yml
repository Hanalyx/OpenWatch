title: Configure journald to compress logs
description: >
  The systemd-journald service should be configured to compress log
  files to conserve disk space while maintaining log integrity.
rationale: >
  Log compression reduces disk usage and extends the retention period
  for logs within the same storage capacity, improving the ability
  to maintain audit trails.
