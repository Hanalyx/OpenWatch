title: Ensure systemd-journal-remote socket is disabled
description: >
  The systemd-journal-remote service should be disabled unless the
  system is specifically configured as a log collection server.
rationale: >
  Running a log collection service when not required increases the
  attack surface. Only systems designated as log aggregators should
  accept remote journal entries.
