title: Ensure systemd-journal-remote is installed
description: >
  If centralized logging is required, the systemd-journal-remote package
  provides the capability to send journal entries to a remote server.
rationale: >
  Centralized logging enables correlation of events across multiple
  systems and protects log integrity in case of system compromise.
  The package must be installed before configuration.
