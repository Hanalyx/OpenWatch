title: Configure journald to store logs persistently
description: >
  The systemd-journald service should be configured to store logs
  persistently on disk rather than only in volatile memory.
rationale: >
  Persistent logging ensures logs survive reboots and are available
  for forensic analysis and compliance auditing. Without persistent
  storage, logs are lost when the system restarts.
