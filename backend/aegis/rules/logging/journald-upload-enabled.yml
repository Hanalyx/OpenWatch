title: Ensure systemd-journal-upload is enabled
description: >
  If centralized logging is required, the systemd-journal-upload service
  must be enabled to send journal entries to a remote log collection server.
rationale: >
  Without the journal-upload service enabled, log entries will not be
  forwarded to centralized logging infrastructure, potentially leaving
  gaps in security monitoring.
