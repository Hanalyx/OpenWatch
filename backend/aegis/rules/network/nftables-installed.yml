title: Ensure nftables is installed
description: >
  The nftables package provides the framework for packet filtering.
  It replaces legacy iptables and is the recommended firewall backend.
rationale: >
  Network traffic filtering is essential for security. nftables provides
  a modern, performant filtering framework. It should be installed even
  if firewalld is used as the frontend.
