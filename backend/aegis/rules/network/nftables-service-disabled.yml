title: Ensure nftables service is disabled when using firewalld
description: >
  When using firewalld as the firewall management tool, the nftables
  service should be disabled to avoid conflicts. Firewalld manages
  nftables rules directly.
rationale: >
  Running both firewalld and the nftables service can cause rule
  conflicts and unpredictable behavior. Choose one management
  interface and disable the other.
