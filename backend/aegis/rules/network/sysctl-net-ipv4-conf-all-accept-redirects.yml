title: Disable accepting ICMP redirects on all interfaces
description: >
  ICMP redirects are used by routers to inform hosts of a better route to a
  destination. On secure networks, this feature should be disabled to prevent
  potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
rationale: >
  An attacker could send spoofed ICMP redirect messages to divert traffic
  through a malicious system, enabling packet interception or modification.
