title: Disable source routed packets on all interfaces
description: >
  Source routed packets allow the sender to specify the route the packet should
  take through the network. This feature should be disabled as it can be used
  to bypass network security devices.
rationale: >
  Accepting source-routed packets allows an attacker to specify the path that
  packets take through the network, potentially bypassing firewalls, intrusion
  detection systems, and other security controls.
