title: Disable accepting secure ICMP redirects on all interfaces
description: >
  Secure ICMP redirects are the same as ICMP redirects except they come from
  gateways listed in the default gateway list. Even secure redirects should
  be disabled on systems that are not routers.
rationale: >
  Accepting ICMP redirects, even from known gateways, can be exploited if
  an attacker compromises a router or spoofs its address.
