title: Disable sending ICMP redirects on all interfaces
description: >
  ICMP redirects are used by routers to inform hosts of a better route to a
  destination. A system that is not acting as a router should not send ICMP
  redirects.
rationale: >
  An attacker could use a compromised host to send ICMP redirects to other
  hosts, potentially redirecting traffic through malicious systems for
  interception or modification.
