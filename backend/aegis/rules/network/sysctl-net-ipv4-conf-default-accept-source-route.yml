title: Disable source routed packets on new interfaces
description: >
  Source routed packets allow the sender to specify the route the packet should
  take. New interfaces should not accept source-routed packets by default.
rationale: >
  Accepting source-routed packets allows an attacker to specify the path that
  packets take through the network, potentially bypassing security controls.
