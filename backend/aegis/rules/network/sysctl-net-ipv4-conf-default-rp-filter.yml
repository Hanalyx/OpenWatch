title: Enable reverse path filtering on new interfaces
description: >
  New network interfaces should have reverse path filtering enabled by default
  to protect against IP spoofing attacks.
rationale: >
  Without reverse path filtering, an attacker can send packets with spoofed
  source addresses that bypass source-based access controls.
