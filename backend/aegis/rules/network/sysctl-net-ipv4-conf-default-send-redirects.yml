title: Disable sending ICMP redirects on new interfaces
description: >
  ICMP redirects are used by routers to inform hosts of a better route to a
  destination. New network interfaces should not send ICMP redirects by default.
rationale: >
  An attacker could use a compromised host to send ICMP redirects to other
  hosts, potentially redirecting traffic through malicious systems.
