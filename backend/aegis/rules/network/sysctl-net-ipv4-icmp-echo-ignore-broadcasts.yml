title: Ignore ICMP broadcast echo requests
description: >
  ICMP broadcast echo requests (Smurf attacks) must be ignored. Responding to
  broadcast ICMP requests can be used to amplify denial-of-service attacks.
rationale: >
  Accepting ICMP echo requests to broadcast addresses could allow an attacker
  to use the system as a reflector in a distributed denial-of-service attack.
