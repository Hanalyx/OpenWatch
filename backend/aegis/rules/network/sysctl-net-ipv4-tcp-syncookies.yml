title: Enable TCP SYN cookies
description: >
  TCP SYN cookies must be enabled to protect against SYN flood attacks when
  the SYN backlog queue fills up. This is a defense mechanism against
  denial-of-service attacks.
rationale: >
  Without SYN cookies, an attacker can exhaust server resources by sending
  a flood of SYN packets without completing the TCP handshake, preventing
  legitimate connections.
