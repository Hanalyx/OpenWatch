title: Disable IPv6 router advertisements on all interfaces
description: >
  Router advertisements are used in IPv6 for stateless address autoconfiguration.
  Systems should not accept router advertisements unless specifically required
  for network operation.
rationale: >
  Accepting IPv6 router advertisements could allow an attacker to redirect
  traffic or configure the system to use a malicious default gateway.
