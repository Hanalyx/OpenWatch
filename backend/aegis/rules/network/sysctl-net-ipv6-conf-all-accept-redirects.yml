title: Disable IPv6 ICMP redirects on all interfaces
description: >
  IPv6 ICMP redirects are used by routers to inform hosts of better routes.
  This feature should be disabled to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
rationale: >
  An attacker could send spoofed IPv6 ICMP redirect messages to divert
  traffic through a malicious system.
