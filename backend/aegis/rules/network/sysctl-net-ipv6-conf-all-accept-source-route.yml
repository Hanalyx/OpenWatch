title: Disable IPv6 source routed packets on all interfaces
description: >
  IPv6 source routed packets allow the sender to specify the route. This
  should be disabled to prevent bypassing network security controls.
rationale: >
  Accepting source-routed packets allows attackers to specify packet paths
  through the network, potentially bypassing firewalls and IDS.
