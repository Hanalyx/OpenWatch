title: Disable IPv6 forwarding
description: >
  IPv6 forwarding allows the system to act as a router, forwarding IPv6
  packets between interfaces. On non-router systems, this must be disabled.
rationale: >
  An attacker could use a compromised host with IPv6 forwarding enabled to
  route traffic between networks, bypassing firewall controls.
