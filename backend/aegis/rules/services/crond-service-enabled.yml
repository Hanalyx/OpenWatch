title: Enable crond service
description: >
  The crond daemon must be enabled and running to execute scheduled jobs.
  Cron is essential for many system maintenance and security tasks.
rationale: >
  Many security and maintenance tasks rely on cron scheduling, including
  log rotation, AIDE integrity checks, and security updates. Without crond,
  these automated tasks will not run.
