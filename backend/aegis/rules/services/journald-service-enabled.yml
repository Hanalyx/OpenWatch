title: Enable journald service
description: >
  The systemd-journald service must be enabled and running to collect
  system logs. Journald is the default logging service on modern Linux
  systems using systemd.
rationale: >
  System logging is critical for security monitoring, incident response,
  and troubleshooting. Without journald, security-relevant events may not
  be recorded, hindering forensic analysis.
