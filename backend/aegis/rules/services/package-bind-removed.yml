title: Ensure bind (DNS server) is not installed
description: >
  The bind package provides DNS server functionality. Unless the system
  is a designated DNS server, this package should not be installed.
rationale: >
  Running a DNS server increases the attack surface. DNS servers have
  been historically targeted for cache poisoning, amplification attacks,
  and other exploits. Remove if not required.
