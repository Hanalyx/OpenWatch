title: Ensure cyrus-imapd is not installed
description: >
  The cyrus-imapd package provides IMAP mail server functionality.
  Unless the system is a designated mail server, this package should not
  be installed.
rationale: >
  IMAP servers provide network-accessible mail services and have been
  targets of security vulnerabilities. Removing unnecessary mail server
  software reduces the attack surface.
