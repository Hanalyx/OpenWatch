title: Ensure dnsmasq is not installed
description: >
  The dnsmasq package provides DNS, DHCP, and TFTP services. Unless
  specifically required, this package should not be installed.
rationale: >
  Dnsmasq provides multiple network services that increase the attack
  surface. Each service has its own potential vulnerabilities. Remove
  unless specifically required for the system's role.
