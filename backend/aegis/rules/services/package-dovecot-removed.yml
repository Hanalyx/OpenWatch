title: Ensure dovecot is not installed
description: >
  The dovecot package provides IMAP and POP3 mail server functionality.
  Unless the system is a designated mail server, this package should not
  be installed.
rationale: >
  Mail servers are high-value targets for attackers. Unless specifically
  required, removing dovecot reduces the attack surface and eliminates
  potential mail-related vulnerabilities.
