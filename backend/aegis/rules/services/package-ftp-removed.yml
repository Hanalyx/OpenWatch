title: Ensure ftp client is not installed
description: >
  The ftp package provides the FTP client which transmits credentials
  in cleartext. This package should not be installed unless absolutely
  required.
rationale: >
  FTP transmits usernames and passwords in cleartext, making credentials
  visible to network sniffers. Secure alternatives like SFTP or SCP
  should be used instead.
