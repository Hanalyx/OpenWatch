title: Ensure net-snmp is not installed
description: >
  The net-snmp package provides SNMP agent functionality. Unless SNMP
  monitoring is specifically required and properly secured, this package
  should not be installed.
rationale: >
  SNMP can expose sensitive system information and has had security
  vulnerabilities. If not required for monitoring, removing it reduces
  the attack surface.
