title: Ensure nginx is not installed
description: >
  The nginx package provides web server functionality. Unless the system
  is a designated web server, this package should not be installed.
rationale: >
  Web servers are high-profile targets for attacks. Installing nginx when
  not needed increases the attack surface and may expose the system to
  web-related vulnerabilities.
