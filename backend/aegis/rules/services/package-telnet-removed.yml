title: Ensure telnet client is not installed
description: >
  The telnet package provides an insecure remote login client that
  transmits credentials and data in cleartext. It should not be
  installed.
rationale: >
  Telnet transmits all data including passwords in cleartext, making
  it trivial to intercept credentials. SSH should be used for all
  remote access needs.
