title: Ensure tftp client is not installed
description: >
  The tftp package provides a TFTP client. TFTP is an unauthenticated
  file transfer protocol and should not be used.
rationale: >
  TFTP provides no authentication or encryption. It should only be
  used in isolated network segments for specific purposes like PXE
  boot. The client package is rarely needed.
