title: Ensure xinetd is not installed
description: >
  The xinetd package is a legacy super-server daemon used to start
  network services on demand. Modern systems use systemd socket
  activation instead.
rationale: >
  Xinetd is a legacy service with a history of security issues. It should
  be replaced with systemd socket activation for any required on-demand
  services.
