title: Ensure X Window server is not installed
description: >
  The xorg-x11-server-common package provides the X Window display
  server. Unless a graphical interface is required, this should not
  be installed on servers.
rationale: >
  X Window servers increase the attack surface and resource usage on
  servers. Unless a GUI is specifically required, servers should run
  in multi-user text mode.
