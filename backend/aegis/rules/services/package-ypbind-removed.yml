title: Ensure NIS client (ypbind) is not installed
description: >
  The ypbind package is the NIS (Network Information Service) client.
  NIS is an insecure legacy protocol and should not be used.
rationale: >
  NIS transmits authentication data unencrypted and has known security
  weaknesses. Modern alternatives like LDAP with TLS or Kerberos should
  be used instead.
