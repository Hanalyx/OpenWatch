title: Ensure NIS server (ypserv) is not installed
description: >
  The ypserv package provides NIS (Network Information Service) server
  functionality. NIS is an insecure legacy protocol and should not be used.
rationale: >
  NIS servers transmit user credentials and authentication data without
  encryption. The protocol has fundamental security weaknesses and should
  be replaced with modern alternatives.
