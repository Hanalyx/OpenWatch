title: Ensure krb5-server package is not installed
description: >
  The krb5-server package provides the Kerberos KDC and related services.
  Unless the system is a designated Kerberos server, this package should
  not be installed.
rationale: >
  Running unnecessary services increases the attack surface. The Kerberos
  server should only be installed on designated authentication servers.
