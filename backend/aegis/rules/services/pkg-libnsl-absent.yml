title: Ensure libnsl package is not installed
description: >
  The libnsl package provides the legacy NIS/YP library. This library
  supports insecure authentication methods and should not be installed
  unless specifically required.
rationale: >
  NIS/YP is an insecure authentication mechanism that transmits data
  in cleartext. Removing this library eliminates dependencies on
  legacy insecure services.
