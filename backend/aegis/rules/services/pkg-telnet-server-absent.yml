description: >
  The telnet-server package provides the telnet daemon which allows
  remote logins using the insecure telnet protocol. This package must
  not be installed.
rationale: >
  Telnet transmits all data including authentication credentials in
  cleartext. The telnet server must not be installed as it provides
  an insecure remote access mechanism.
