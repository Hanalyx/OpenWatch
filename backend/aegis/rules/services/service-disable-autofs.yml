title: Disable autofs service
description: >
  The autofs service automatically mounts filesystems when accessed.
  It should be disabled unless automounting is required.
rationale: >
  Automounting can introduce security risks by automatically mounting
  potentially malicious filesystems. Explicit mounting provides better
  control and auditability.
