title: Disable Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD daemon
description: >
  Avahi is a system daemon which implements Zeroconf networking. Unless
  required for network discovery, this service should be disabled.
rationale: >
  Unnecessary services increase the attack surface. Avahi could expose
  information about services running on the system to the local network.
