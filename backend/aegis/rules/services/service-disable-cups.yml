title: Disable CUPS print service
description: >
  The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) provides printing services. On systems
  that do not require printing, this service should be disabled.
rationale: >
  Unnecessary services increase the attack surface. CUPS has historically had
  security vulnerabilities and should be disabled if not needed.
