title: Disable kdump service
description: >
  The kdump service captures kernel crash dumps for debugging. Unless
  required for troubleshooting, it should be disabled.
rationale: >
  Kernel crash dumps may contain sensitive information from memory,
  including passwords and encryption keys. Disabling kdump prevents
  this data from being written to disk.
