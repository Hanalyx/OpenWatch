title: Ensure mcstrans is not installed
description: >
  The mcstransd daemon provides MCS (Multi-Category Security) translation
  services for SELinux. It translates SELinux context labels to human-readable
  format. This service is not required for SELinux enforcement.
rationale: >
  The mcstrans daemon is not needed for SELinux operation and provides an
  additional attack surface. If an attacker can manipulate translations, it
  could lead to misleading security context information.
