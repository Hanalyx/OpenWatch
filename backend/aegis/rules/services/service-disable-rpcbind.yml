title: Disable rpcbind service
description: >
  The rpcbind service maps RPC services to the ports they listen on. Unless
  NFS or other RPC services are required, this should be disabled.
rationale: >
  rpcbind is required for NFS and other RPC-based services. If these are not
  needed, rpcbind exposes unnecessary attack surface.
