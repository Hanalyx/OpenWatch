title: Disable Samba file sharing
description: >
  Samba provides Windows file sharing (SMB/CIFS) services. Unless required
  for Windows interoperability, this service should be disabled.

  SMB has been the target of many security vulnerabilities. Running an
  unnecessary Samba server increases the attack surface.
