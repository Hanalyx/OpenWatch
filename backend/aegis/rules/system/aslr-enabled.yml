title: Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
description: >
  ASLR randomizes memory addresses used by system and application processes,
  making it more difficult for attackers to exploit memory corruption
  vulnerabilities.
rationale: >
  ASLR is a key defense against buffer overflow and memory corruption
  attacks. By randomizing memory layout, attackers cannot reliably predict
  target addresses for exploitation.
