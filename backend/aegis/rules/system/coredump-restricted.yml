title: Restrict core dumps
description: >
  Core dumps should be restricted to prevent sensitive information
  from being written to disk when a program crashes.
rationale: >
  Core dumps may contain sensitive data like passwords, encryption keys,
  or other confidential information from program memory. Restricting
  core dumps prevents this data from being written to disk.
