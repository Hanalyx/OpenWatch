title: Disable core dumps for SUID programs
description: >
  Core dumps for SUID programs should be disabled via the
  fs.suid_dumpable sysctl parameter.
rationale: >
  SUID programs run with elevated privileges and their memory may
  contain sensitive data. Preventing core dumps from these programs
  protects privileged information from being written to disk.
