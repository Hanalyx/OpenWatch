title: Disable Ctrl-Alt-Delete reboot
description: >
  The Ctrl-Alt-Delete key combination should be disabled to prevent
  unauthorized reboots from the console.
rationale: >
  Allowing users to reboot with Ctrl-Alt-Delete could cause denial of
  service or allow attackers with physical access to disrupt operations
  and potentially boot into single-user mode.
