title: Enable FIPS 140-2 mode
description: >
  The system must be configured to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic
  modules for all cryptographic operations.
rationale: >
  FIPS 140-2 compliance ensures that only validated cryptographic algorithms
  are used, which is required for processing sensitive government data
  and meeting federal security requirements.

        Enable FIPS mode using:
        fips-mode-setup --enable
        A system reboot is required after enabling FIPS mode.
        WARNING: Enabling FIPS may break some applications that rely on
        non-FIPS approved algorithms.
