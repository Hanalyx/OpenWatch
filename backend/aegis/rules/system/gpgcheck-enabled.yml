title: Enable GPG signature checking for packages
description: >
  The gpgcheck option in /etc/dnf/dnf.conf must be enabled to ensure
  all packages are verified using GPG signatures before installation.
rationale: >
  GPG signature verification ensures packages come from trusted sources
  and have not been tampered with. Without this, malicious packages
  could be installed on the system.
