title: Configure audit backlog limit in GRUB
description: >
  The kernel audit_backlog_limit parameter should be set sufficiently high
  to prevent audit events from being dropped during boot and high-activity
  periods.
rationale: >
  If the audit backlog fills before auditd starts or during periods of high
  system activity, audit events may be lost. A backlog limit of at least
  8192 ensures events are captured during boot and high-load situations.
