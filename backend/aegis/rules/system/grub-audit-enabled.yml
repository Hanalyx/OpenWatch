title: Enable auditing in GRUB kernel parameters
description: >
  The audit=1 kernel parameter must be set to enable auditing for processes
  that start before auditd. This ensures all system activity is captured
  from boot.
rationale: >
  Without audit=1, processes started early in the boot sequence before
  auditd loads are not audited. This could allow early compromise activities
  to go unrecorded.
