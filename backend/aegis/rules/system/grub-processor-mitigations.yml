title: Enable processor vulnerability mitigations in GRUB
description: >
  The pti=on kernel parameter must be set to enable Kernel Page Table
  Isolation (KPTI) to mitigate processor-based vulnerabilities like
  Meltdown and Spectre.
rationale: >
  Modern processors have speculative execution vulnerabilities that can
  allow unauthorized access to kernel memory. KPTI separates kernel and
  user page tables to mitigate these attacks.
