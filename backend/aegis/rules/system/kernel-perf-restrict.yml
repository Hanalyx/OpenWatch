title: Restrict use of performance events
description: >
  The kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl must be set to restrict access
  to performance monitoring events.
rationale: >
  Performance events can be used for side-channel attacks or to gather
  information about system activity. Restricting access prevents
  unauthorized profiling.
