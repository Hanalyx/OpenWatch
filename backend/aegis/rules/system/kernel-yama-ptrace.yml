title: Restrict ptrace scope
description: >
  The kernel.yama.ptrace_scope sysctl must be set to restrict which
  processes can use ptrace on other processes.
rationale: >
  ptrace can be used by attackers to inspect and modify running
  processes. Restricting ptrace scope limits the ability to debug
  or inject code into other processes.
