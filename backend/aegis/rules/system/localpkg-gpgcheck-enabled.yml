title: Enable GPG checking for local packages
description: >
  The localpkg_gpgcheck option should be enabled to verify GPG signatures
  on locally installed packages (RPM files not from repositories).
rationale: >
  Verifying local packages ensures that manually installed RPMs are
  from trusted sources and have not been modified, preventing
  installation of tampered or malicious packages.
