title: Ensure no duplicate group names exist
description: >
  All group names in /etc/group must be unique. Duplicate group names
  can cause unpredictable behavior and security issues.
rationale: >
  Duplicate group names can lead to confusion about group membership
  and may result in incorrect access control decisions if groups share
  the same name with different GIDs.
