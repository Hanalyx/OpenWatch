title: Enable GPG checking for repository metadata
description: >
  The repo_gpgcheck option should be enabled to verify GPG signatures
  on repository metadata in addition to individual packages.
rationale: >
  Verifying repository metadata ensures the package lists themselves
  have not been tampered with, preventing downgrade attacks and
  ensuring package integrity from source to installation.
