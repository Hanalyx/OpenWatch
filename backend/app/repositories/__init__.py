Repository Pattern - DEPRECATED

MongoDB repositories have been removed. All data access now goes through
PostgreSQL via SQL Builders (see app/utils/query_builder.py) or
Aegis for compliance rules.

This module is kept as an empty package for import compatibility.
Repository classes no longer exist.
