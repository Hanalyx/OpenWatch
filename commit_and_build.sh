git commit -m "Fix owadm directory permission handling for production installations

- Handle permission errors gracefully in CreateRequiredDirectories with warnings instead of failures
- Improve production vs development environment detection in CheckEnvironmentFiles  
- Skip chmod operations when permissions are already correct
- Add proper logging for production installation detection
- Remove emojis from owadm output for terminal compatibility
- Update RPM to version 1.2.1-7 with comprehensive cleanup script
- Switch to system containers instead of rootless for compatibility

Resolves the 'operation not permitted' errors on security/keys directory
and missing backend/app/main.py issues reported in ow-fedora-error9.txt
