    "rationale": "Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e.,\nlocal logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when\nnetwork or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used\naccounts are not subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts\nare accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by\nmaintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period\nmay be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must\nnot be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for\nprivileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.\n\nTo address access requirements the SUSE operating system can be integrated\nwith enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed\naccess control policy requirements.",
