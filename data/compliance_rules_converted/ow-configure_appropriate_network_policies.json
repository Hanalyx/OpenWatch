    "description": "Configure Network Policies in any application namespace in an appropriate way, so that\nonly the required communications are allowed. The Network Policies should precisely define\nsource and target using label selectors and ports.",
    "rationale": "By default, all pod to pod traffic within a cluster is allowed. Network\nPolicy creates a pod- level firewall that can be used to restrict traffic\nbetween sources. Pod traffic is restricted by having a Network Policy that\nselects it (through the use of labels). Once there is any Network Policy in a\nnamespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections\nthat are not allowed by any Network Policy. Other pods in the namespace that\nare not selected by any Network Policy will continue to accept all traffic.\n\nImplementing Kubernetes Network Policies with minimal allowed communication enhances security\nby reducing entry points and limiting attacker movement within the cluster. It ensures pods and\nservices communicate only with necessary entities, reducing unauthorized access risks. In case\nof a breach, these policies contain compromised pods, preventing widespread malicious activity.\nAdditionally, they enhance monitoring and detection of anomalous network activities.",
