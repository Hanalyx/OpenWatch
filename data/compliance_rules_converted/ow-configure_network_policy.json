    "rationale": "By default, all pod to pod traffic within a cluster is allowed. Network\nPolicy creates a pod- level firewall that can be used to restrict traffic\nbetween sources. Pod traffic is restricted by having a Network Policy that\nselects it (through the use of labels). Once there is any Network Policy in a\nnamespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections\nthat are not allowed by any Network Policy. Other pods in the namespace that\nare not selected by any Network Policy will continue to accept all traffic.\n\nNetwork Policies are managed via the Kubernetes Network Policy API and\nenforced by a network plugin, simply creating the resource without a\ncompatible network plugin to implement it will have no effect. EKS supports\nNetwork Policy enforcement through the use of Calico.",
