    "description": "Enable Endpoint Private Access to restrict access to the cluster's control\nplane to only an allowlist of authorized IPs.",
    "rationale": "Authorized networks are a way of specifying a restricted range of IP\naddresses that are permitted to access your cluster's control plane.\nKubernetes Engine uses both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication\nto provide secure access to your cluster's control plane from the public\ninternet. This provides you the flexibility to administer your cluster from\nanywhere; however, you might want to further restrict access to a set of IP\naddresses that you control. You can set this restriction by specifying an\nauthorized network. Restricting access to an authorized network can provide\nadditional security benefits for your container cluster, including:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an\nadditional layer of security by limiting external access to a specific set\nof addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your\npremises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a\nvulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization\nmechanism.</li>\n<li>Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect\nyour cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your\ncompany's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside Amazon EC2 and\noutside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your\ncompany) are still denied access.</li>\n</ul>",
