    "rationale": "Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the\noverall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the\nsoftware has not been tampered and has been provided by a trusted vendor.\nAccordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system\ncomponents must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by\nthe organization. Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to\ninstallation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from\na vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it\nhas been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are\ndisallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have\nto verify the software again. NOTE: For U.S. Military systems, this\nrequirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,\nthe certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved\nCertificate Authority.",
