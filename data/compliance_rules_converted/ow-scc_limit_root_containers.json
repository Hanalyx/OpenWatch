    "rationale": "It is strongly recommended that containers running on OpenShift\nshould support running as any arbitrary UID. OpenShift will then assign\na random, non-privileged UID to the running container instance. This\navoids the risk from containers running with specific uids that could\nmap to host service accounts, or an even greater risk of running as root\nlevel service.  OpenShift uses the default security context constraints\n(SCC), restricted, to prevent containers from running as root or other\nprivileged user ids. Pods may be configured to use an scc policy\nthat allows the container to run as a specific uid, including root(0)\nwhen approved. Only a cluster administrator may grant the change of\nan scc policy.",
