The list consists of\n  space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with\n  this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user\n  access further by specifically allowing a user's access only from a\n  particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.\n- AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of\n  allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list\n  consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not\n  recognized with this variable.\n- DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of\n  denying specific users to ssh into the system.
