    "rationale": "This form of distributed configuration is considered as a good practice, and as other sshd rules assume that directives in files in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</tt> config directory are effective, there has to be a rule that ensures this.\nAside from that, having multiple configuration files makes the SSH Server configuration changes easier to partition according to the reason that they were introduced, and therefore it should help to perform merges of hardening updates.",
