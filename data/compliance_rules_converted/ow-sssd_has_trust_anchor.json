    "rationale": "Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when\npresented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.\n\nA trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It\nis used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.\n\nWhen there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor;\nit can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the\nsubject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted\nroot certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThis requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for\ncertificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is\nnecessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any\ncertificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes\ncertificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.\nValidation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.",
