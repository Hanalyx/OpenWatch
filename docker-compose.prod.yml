# OpenWatch Production Docker Compose Overlay
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# This overlay applies production-specific settings on top of the base
# docker-compose.yml. It disables debug mode, enables HTTPS and FIPS,
# adds resource limits, and tightens health check intervals.
