# Script Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Action:** Removed 52 obsolete scripts (71% reduction)

## What Was Removed

### Root Directory (14 scripts)
- Build automation scripts (RPM packaging deprecated)
- One-time fix/analysis scripts
- Git automation scripts

### Backend Directory (11 scripts)
- Debug/test scripts replaced by proper test suite in `backend/tests/`
- One-time migration scripts already applied

### Scripts Directory (22 scripts + 1 image)
- Temporary test iteration scripts
- Debug screenshots

### Frontend Directory (1 script)
- Debug script

## What Was Kept (21 scripts)

### Production Critical
- `start-openwatch.sh` - Main entry point
- `stop-openwatch.sh` - Safe shutdown

### Utilities
- `backend/reset_admin_password.py` - Password recovery
- `backend/migrate_system_credentials.py` - Migration utility  
- `backend/run_migration.py` - Schema updates
- `scripts/create-admin.sh` - User management
- `scripts/generate-certs.sh` - TLS setup
- `scripts/install-systemd-services.sh` - Production deployment
- `scripts/production-health-check.sh` - Monitoring
- `scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh` - Automated testing
- `scripts/run-local.sh` - Development workflow

### Container Runtime
- `docker/entrypoint-backend.sh` - Backend entrypoint

### Documentation/Examples
- `examples/aegis_orsa_implementation.py`
- `examples/platform_integrations.py`

### Legitimate Tests (10 in `tests/` directory)
Note: These should be moved to `backend/tests/` for consistency

## Impact

**Production Impact:** ZERO - All removed scripts were temporary/debug

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Cleaner repository (71% reduction)
- ✅ Less developer confusion
- ✅ Reduced attack surface
- ✅ Easier documentation
- ✅ Faster repository operations

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Updated to note RPM packaging deprecated
- ✅ `docs/SSH_VALIDATION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Removed monitoring script reference
- ✅ Created `SCRIPT_CLEANUP_ASSESSMENT.md` - Full analysis

## Verification

```bash
# Root scripts (should be 2 + start/stop)
ls -1 *.sh *.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l
# Expected: 2 (.sh files only)

# Backend utilities (should be 3)
ls -1 backend/*.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l  
# Expected: 3

# Scripts directory (should be 6)
ls -1 scripts/*.sh scripts/*.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l
# Expected: 6
```

## Next Steps

Optional improvements:
1. Move `tests/` directory to `backend/tests/` for consistency
2. Update `.gitignore` to prevent future test script commits
3. Archive removed scripts to a separate `archive/` branch if needed
