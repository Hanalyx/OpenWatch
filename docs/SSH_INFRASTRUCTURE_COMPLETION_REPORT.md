5. Regularly review audit logs for SSH-related security events

### For Security Teams
1. Enforce strong SSH key standards (RSA 2048+ or Ed25519)
2. Implement SSH key rotation policies through system credential updates
3. Monitor authentication failures through audit logging
4. Review SSH access patterns for anomalous behavior
5. Maintain principle of least privilege for SSH user accounts

2. Document host-specific SSH requirements (special users, ports, etc.)
3. Maintain SSH connectivity baselines for performance monitoring
4. Plan SSH maintenance windows for system credential updates
5. Test disaster recovery procedures for SSH system reset scenarios

## Future Considerations
