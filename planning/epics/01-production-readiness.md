# Epic: Production Readiness

## Overview
Resolve all deployment blockers and ensure OpenWatch can be deployed in production environments without errors.

## Status: ðŸ”´ Critical - Blocking Publication

## Objectives
- Fix all TypeScript compilation errors in frontend
- Resolve Python import and dependency issues in backend
- Fix database schema initialization problems
- Replace hardcoded paths with configurable environment variables
- Ensure clean Docker/Podman containerization

## User Stories

### Frontend Build Stabilization
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** the frontend to build without TypeScript errors  
**So that** I can deploy OpenWatch in containerized environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All Material-UI type mismatches resolved
- QR code library imports fixed
- TypeScript strict mode compliance achieved
- Docker build succeeds without errors

### Backend Import Resolution
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the backend to start without import errors  
**So that** the API is accessible and functional

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All Python type imports corrected
- OpenTelemetry dependencies properly configured
- Circular imports eliminated
- API starts successfully in production mode

### Database Schema Fix
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** the database to initialize correctly  
**So that** RBAC and user management function properly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- MFA fields have proper defaults
- User initialization includes all required fields
- Database migrations run successfully
- Admin user created on first startup

### Path Configuration
**As a** deployment engineer  
**I want** all paths to be configurable via environment variables  
**So that** I can deploy to different environments without code changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Log paths configurable via env vars
- Data directories configurable
- Certificate paths configurable
- No hardcoded absolute paths in code

## Technical Requirements
- Fix TypeScript/Material-UI version compatibility
- Update requirements.txt with all dependencies
- Add proper default values to database schema
- Implement environment-based configuration
- Test containerized deployment thoroughly

## Dependencies
- None - This is the highest priority epic

## Timeline
- Estimated: 2-4 hours
- Priority: P0 - Must complete before any publication

## Success Metrics
- Clean `docker-compose up` with no errors
- All services healthy and accessible
- No import or compilation errors
- Database properly initialized with admin user
