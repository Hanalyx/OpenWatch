# Epic: Security Hardening & Compliance

## Overview
Enhance security features and ensure full FIPS compliance, SSL/TLS implementation, and production-grade security measures.

## Status: ðŸŸ¡ High Priority - Post-Production Readiness

## Objectives
- Complete SSL/TLS certificate generation and management
- Finish FIPS compliance implementation
- Enhance credential encryption with AES-256-GCM
- Implement comprehensive security headers
- Complete audit logging framework

## User Stories

### SSL/TLS Implementation
**As a** security administrator  
**I want** all communications to be encrypted with SSL/TLS  
**So that** data in transit is protected from interception

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Auto-generate self-signed certificates on first run
- Support for custom certificate installation
- HTTPS enforced for all web traffic
- TLS 1.2+ only
- Certificate rotation support

### Enhanced Credential Encryption
**As a** compliance officer  
**I want** all stored credentials to use AES-256-GCM encryption  
**So that** we meet FIPS compliance requirements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SSH credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- API keys properly encrypted at rest
- Key rotation mechanism implemented
- Secure key storage with proper permissions

### Security Headers
**As a** security engineer  
**I want** proper security headers on all HTTP responses  
**So that** common web vulnerabilities are mitigated

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CSP headers configured
- HSTS enabled
- X-Frame-Options set
- X-Content-Type-Options configured
- Referrer-Policy implemented

### Audit Enhancement
**As a** compliance auditor  
**I want** comprehensive audit logs of all security events  
**So that** I can track and investigate security incidents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All authentication events logged
- Configuration changes tracked
- Scan executions recorded
- Failed access attempts logged
- Log rotation and retention policies

## Technical Requirements
- Implement certificate generation with OpenSSL
- Complete AES-256-GCM encryption for credentials
- Add security middleware to FastAPI
- Enhance audit logging with structured events
- Implement log shipping to external systems

## Dependencies
- Epic 01: Production Readiness (must be complete)

## Timeline
- Estimated: 1-2 days
- Priority: P1 - Critical for production deployment

## Success Metrics
- All traffic encrypted with TLS
- Zero plaintext credentials in database
- Security headers score A+ on securityheaders.com
- Complete audit trail for all security events
