# Epic: Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimize system performance for enterprise-scale deployments, focusing on scan efficiency, database queries, and UI responsiveness.

## Status: ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority

## Objectives
- Enable enhanced SCAP parsing with performance improvements
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Implement caching strategies
- Improve frontend loading times
- Add performance monitoring

## User Stories

### SCAP Parsing Performance
**As a** security analyst  
**I want** detailed SCAP rule information without performance impact  
**So that** I can analyze compliance details efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enhanced parsing re-enabled with optimization
- Rule caching implemented
- Parsing done asynchronously
- Memory usage optimized
- Large SCAP files handled efficiently

### Database Optimization
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** fast query response times even with large datasets  
**So that** the system remains responsive at scale

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Proper indexes on all foreign keys
- Query optimization for common operations
- Connection pooling tuned
- Slow query logging enabled
- Database statistics updated regularly

### Frontend Performance
**As a** end user  
**I want** fast page load times and responsive UI  
**So that** I can work efficiently without delays

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Code splitting implemented
- Lazy loading for large components
- API response caching
- Optimistic UI updates
- Bundle size < 500KB initial load

### Caching Strategy
**As a** platform engineer  
**I want** intelligent caching at multiple layers  
**So that** repeated operations are fast

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Redis caching for API responses
- Frontend state caching
- SCAP content caching
- Static asset caching with CDN support
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Technical Requirements
- Re-implement enhanced SCAP parsing with worker threads
- Add database query analysis and optimization
- Implement Redis caching layer
- Add performance monitoring with metrics
- Optimize frontend bundle with webpack

## Dependencies
- Epic 01: Production Readiness
- Epic 02: Security Hardening (partial)

## Timeline
- Estimated: 3-5 days
- Priority: P2 - Important for scale

## Success Metrics
- SCAP parsing < 10 seconds for large files
- API response times < 200ms average
- Frontend First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Database queries < 100ms for common operations
- Support for 10,000+ hosts
