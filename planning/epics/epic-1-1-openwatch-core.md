### üöß IN PROGRESS - Partially Working with Critical Issues (45%)

#### Frontend Application (Major Integration Issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è React TypeScript frontend exists but has connection problems
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Login page functional but shows JSON parsing errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard components coded but data loading inconsistent
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Navigation structure complete but pages may not load
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Material-UI v5 implementation with TypeScript issues

#### Service Integration (Reliability Issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redis reported as "unhealthy" affecting background tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend-backend communication frequently fails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Celery workers may not be running consistently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Docker/Podman containerization with networking issues

#### Scanning Workflow (Backend Ready, Frontend Broken)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scan execution works from backend but frontend initiation broken
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time progress tracking implemented but not displaying
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Results storage working but display layer problematic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Report generation unclear due to frontend issues

#### Dashboard & Reporting (Implementation Complete, Display Issues)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard layout and widgets coded but data loading problems
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance scoring logic implemented but may not display
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Activity feed and metrics collection working backend-side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chart and visualization components exist but integration broken

### ‚ùå PENDING - Not Working or Not Started (10%)

#### Advanced Features (Future Development)
- [ ] Rule-specific rescanning (backend route exists, not integrated)
- [ ] Enhanced SCAP parsing (disabled for performance)
- [ ] Terminal access integration (route commented out)
- [ ] Plugin system (interface exists, no plugins)
- [ ] LDAP/Active Directory integration
- [ ] SIEM connectors (Splunk, QRadar)

#### Testing & Quality (Critical Gap)
- [ ] End-to-end testing of scan workflows
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration testing
- [ ] Multi-user concurrent access testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking under load
- [ ] Service reliability testing

#### Production Deployment (Major Blockers)
- [ ] Stable service orchestration
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Network connectivity resolution
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS

### Immediate Priorities (P0 - Must Fix Today)
1. **Service Integration**: Fix Redis connectivity and Celery worker stability
2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Resolve API proxy configuration and connection issues
3. **Authentication Flow**: Debug JSON parsing errors in login process
4. **Dashboard Data Loading**: Fix data fetching and display issues
5. **Real-time Updates**: Implement proper error handling for failed API calls

### Next Sprint (P1 - This Week)
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete scan workflows work from UI
2. **Service Reliability**: Ensure all containers start and remain healthy
3. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful degradation for service failures
4. **Performance Testing**: Validate system under realistic load

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode violations
- Missing error handling in some services
- Commented out features (terminal access, tracing)
- Hardcoded configuration values

### Testing
- Limited unit test coverage (~10%)
- No integration tests
- E2E tests incomplete
- No load testing framework

### Documentation
- Missing inline code documentation
- API client examples needed
- Deployment guide incomplete
- Troubleshooting guide missing

## Dependencies

### External
- OpenSCAP scanner (v1.3.x)
- PostgreSQL (v13+)
- Redis (v6+)
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+)

### Internal
- AEGIS platform (for remediation)
- Authentication service
- Audit logging service

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large SCAP files
- **Mitigation**: Implement async parsing with worker pools

- **Risk**: Scalability limits with current architecture
- **Mitigation**: Design for horizontal scaling, implement caching

### Security Risks
- **Risk**: Credential exposure in logs
- **Mitigation**: Audit all logging statements, use structured logging

## Success Metrics

### Functionality
- [ ] All core features operational
- [ ] < 0.1% error rate in production
- [ ] 99.9% uptime for critical services

### Performance
- [ ] Scan initiation < 2 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard load < 1 second
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent users

### Quality
- [ ] > 80% test coverage
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] All OWASP Top 10 mitigated

## Conclusion

OpenWatch Core has excellent backend infrastructure (45% fully functional) but suffers from critical frontend-backend integration issues that prevent production deployment. The backend APIs, authentication, host management, and SCAP scanning are well-implemented, but the user interface cannot reliably connect to services.

**Priority**: Fix service integration and frontend connectivity issues before any feature development. The platform is not ready for publication until these critical deployment blockers are resolved.

**Assessment**: Backend = Production Ready, Frontend Integration = Broken, Overall = Not Production Ready
