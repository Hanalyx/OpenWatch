# OpenWatch Secret Rotation Log

This file tracks all secret generation and rotation events for OpenWatch.

**IMPORTANT**: This file does NOT contain actual secret values. All secrets are stored in .env files which are never committed to version control.

## 2025-10-16: Initial Secure Secret Generation (Phase 1 #3)

**Reason:** Security assessment identified weak/hardcoded secrets in development .env files

**Secrets Generated:**
- `OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 64-character hex string (32 bytes random)
- `OPENWATCH_SECRET_KEY`: 64-character hex string (32 bytes random)

**Generation Method:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/.env`: Updated OPENWATCH_SECRET_KEY, OPENWATCH_MASTER_KEY, added OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY
- `.env`: Updated SECRET_KEY, MASTER_KEY, added OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY and OPENWATCH_SECRET_KEY

**Backups Created:**
- `backend/.env.backup-secrets-20251016`
- `.env.backup-secrets-20251016`

**Security Measures:**
- ✅ All .env files confirmed in .gitignore
- ✅ Secrets are 64-character hex strings (256-bit entropy)
- ✅ Used cryptographically secure random generation (OpenSSL)
- ✅ Backups created before modification
- ✅ No secrets committed to git repository

**Key Mapping:**
- `OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` → Used by crypto.py for sensitive data encryption
- `OPENWATCH_SECRET_KEY` → Used for JWT signing and session management
- `OPENWATCH_MASTER_KEY` → Alias for OPENWATCH_ENCRYPTION_KEY (backward compatibility)
- `SECRET_KEY` → Root .env alias for OPENWATCH_SECRET_KEY
- `MASTER_KEY` → Root .env alias for OPENWATCH_MASTER_KEY

**Next Steps:**
- Restart backend and worker containers to apply new secrets
- Verify application starts successfully with new secrets
- Test JWT token generation and validation
- Test encrypted credential storage/retrieval

**Rotation Schedule:**
- Development: Rotate every 90 days
- Production: Rotate every 30 days or on security incident
- Rotate immediately if secrets are suspected to be compromised

## Secret Rotation Checklist Template

When rotating secrets in the future, follow this checklist:

- [ ] Backup current .env files with timestamp
- [ ] Generate new secrets using `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] Update all .env files (backend/.env, .env)
- [ ] Verify .env files are in .gitignore
- [ ] Document rotation event in this log (date, reason, secrets rotated)
- [ ] Restart all services (backend, worker, frontend)
- [ ] Test application functionality (login, scans, credentials)
- [ ] Verify no secrets in git history
- [ ] Update any external integrations using old secrets
- [ ] Archive old secret backups securely (do not commit)

## Emergency Secret Compromise Procedure

If secrets are suspected to be compromised:

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Rotate ALL secrets immediately
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Restart all services
3. **IMMEDIATE**: Invalidate all active JWT tokens (restart Redis)
4. **IMMEDIATE**: Force re-authentication for all users
5. Review access logs for suspicious activity
6. Review git history for any secret commits
7. Scan for secrets in CI/CD logs, container registries
8. Document incident in security log
9. Consider notifying users if credentials were exposed
